Presentation of Consolidated Financial Statements

As
discussed in our 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-KSB, we discovered during the
preparation and review of our 2008 income tax provision that errors occurred in
calculating the GAAP cost basis of our oil and gas properties in determining tax
liability and the estimated deferred tax asset for percentage depletion
carryforward. These errors impacted our previously filed financial statements
for fiscal years ended March 31, 2007 and 2006 and our previously filed interim
financial statements for those years and the first three quarters of 2008. For
further information concerning the restatement and details concerning restated
amounts, please refer to our recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-KSB for the
fiscal year ended March 31, 2008.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting
Pronouncements

Use of Estimates.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the actual amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the actual amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. We base these estimates on assumptions that we understand are
reasonable under the circumstances. The estimated results that are produced by
this effort will differ under different assumptions or conditions.  We
understand that these estimates are necessary and that actual results could vary
significantly from the estimated amounts for the current and future periods.
There are many factors, including global events, which may influence the
production, processing, marketing, and valuation of crude oil and natural gas. A
reduction in the valuation of oil and gas properties resulting from declining
prices or production could adversely impact depletion rates and ceiling test
limitations. We understand the following accounting policies and estimates are
necessary in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: the
carrying value of our oil and gas property, the accounting for oil and gas
reserves, the estimate of our asset retirement obligations, the estimate of our
income tax assets and liabilities and estimates of accrued quantities and prices
in our oil and gas receivable.

Cash and Cash
Equivalents. For purposes of the Consolidated Balance Sheets and
Statements of Cash Flows, we consider all highly liquid investments with a
maturity of ninety days or less when purchased to be cash
equivalents.

Oil and Gas
Property. We utilize the full cost method of accounting for costs related
to our oil and gas property. Capitalized costs included in the full cost pool
are depleted on an aggregate basis over the estimated lives of the properties
using the units-of-production method. These capitalized costs are subject to a
ceiling test that limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value
of future net revenues attributable to proved oil and gas reserves discounted at
10 percent plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties
less any associated tax effects. If the full cost pool of capitalized oil and
gas property costs exceeds the ceiling, we will record a ceiling test write-down
to the extent of such excess. This write-down is a non-cash charge to earnings.
If required, it reduces earnings and impacts shareholders’ equity in the period
of occurrence and results in lower depreciation and depletion in future periods.
The write-down may not be reversed in future periods, even though higher oil and
gas prices may subsequently increase the ceiling. As of September 30,
2008, we determined that our capitalized costs did not exceed the ceiling test
limit.

Table of Contents


 
 
Oil and Gas
Reserves. The determination of depreciation and depletion expense as well
as ceiling test write-downs, if any, related to the recorded value of our oil
and gas properties are highly dependent on the estimates of the proved oil and
gas reserves attributable to these properties. Oil and gas reserves include
proved reserves that represent estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas
which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to
be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and
operating conditions. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating
oil and gas reserves and their values, including many factors beyond our
control. Accordingly, reserve estimates are often different from the quantities
of oil and gas ultimately recovered and the corresponding lifting costs
associated with the recovery of these reserves. Ninety-five percent and
eighty-seven percent of our reported oil and gas reserves at March 31, 2008
and September 30, 2008, respectively, are based on estimates prepared by an
independent petroleum engineering firm. The remaining five and thirteen percent,
respectively, of our oil and gas reserves were prepared in-house.

Asset Retirement
Obligations. We have obligations related to the plugging and abandonment
of our oil and gas wells, the removal of equipment and facilities, and returning
the land to its original condition. SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations” requires that we estimate the future cost of this
obligation, discount this cost to its present value, and record a corresponding
asset and liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The values ultimately
derived are based on many significant estimates, including the ultimate expected
cost of the obligation, the expected future date of the required cash
expenditures, and inflation rates. The nature of these estimates requires us to
make judgments based on historical experience and future expectations related to
timing. We review the estimate of our future asset retirement obligations
quarterly. These quarterly reviews may require revisions to these estimates
based on such things as changes to cost estimates or the timing of future cash
outlays. Any such changes that result in upward or downward revisions in the
estimated obligation will result in an adjustment to the related capitalized
asset and corresponding liability on a prospective basis.
 
We
recognize two components on our consolidated statement of income; accretion of
asset retirement obligations and asset retirement expense.  Accretion
of asset retirement obligation reflects the periodic accretion of the present
value of future plugging and abandonment costs.  Asset retirement
expense reflects the actual current period gains and losses on plugging and
abandonment costs relative to previously estimated future
costs.  Since our initial adoption of FASB No. 143 we have closed
gains and losses on asset retirements to the income statement as a component of
asset retirement expense.

The
information below reconciles the value of the asset retirement obligation for
the period presented.

Income Taxes.
We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
“Accounting for Income Taxes”. Accordingly, deferred tax liabilities and assets
are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial
statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in
effect for the year in which the differences are expected to
reverse.

Table of Contents


 
 
Projections
of future income taxes and their timing require significant estimates with
respect to future operating results. Accordingly, the net deferred tax liability
is continually re-evaluated and numerous estimates are revised over time. As
such, the net deferred tax liability may change significantly as more
information and data is gathered with respect to such events as changes in
commodity prices, their effect on the estimate of oil and gas reserves, and the
depletion of these long-lived reserves.
 
On
April 1, 2007 we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109
(FIN 48). The adoption of FIN 48 had no impact on our consolidated financial
statements. We are subject to U.S. federal income tax and income tax from
multiple state jurisdictions. The tax years remaining subject to examination by
tax authorities are fiscal years 2004 through 2006. We recognize interest and
penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. As of
September 30, 2008, we made no provisions for interest or penalties related to
uncertain tax positions.
 
Earnings Per
Share. Our earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted
earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the diluted weighted
average number of common shares. The diluted weighted average number of common
shares is computed using the treasury stock method for common stock that may be
issued for outstanding stock options.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

In
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (Revised 2007), “Business
Combinations” (“SFAS 141R”). SFAS 141R will significantly change the accounting
for business combinations in a number of areas including the treatment of
contingent consideration, contingencies, acquisition costs, research and
development assets and restructuring costs. In addition, under SFAS 141R,
changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax
uncertainties in a business combination after the measurement period will impact
income taxes. SFAS 141R is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2008. The adoption of the provisions of SFAS 141R is not
expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of income,
or cash flows.

In
February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option
for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities”, providing companies with an
option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The
Standard’s objective is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial
instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets
and liabilities differently. Generally
accepted accounting principles have required different measurement attributes
for different assets and liabilities that can create artificial volatility in
earnings. SFAS 159 helps to mitigate this type of accounting-induced volatility
by enabling companies to report related assets and liabilities at fair value,
which would likely reduce the need for companies to comply with detailed rules
for hedge accounting. SFAS
159 also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to
facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement
attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. The
Standard requires companies to provide additional information that will help
investors and other users of financial statements to more easily understand the
effect of our choice to use fair value on its earnings. It also requires
entities to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the
Company has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet. The
adoption of the provisions of SFAS 159 did not have a material effect on our
financial position, results of income, or cash flows.

Table of Contents



In
September 2006,
the FASB issued SFAS Statement No. 157,
“Fair Value Measurements”. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework
for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
2007.  In
February 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position No.
FAS 157-2.  That guidance proposed a one year deferral of the
implementation of SFAS 157 for non-financial assets and liabilities that
are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis (less frequent
than annually).

On April
1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 157 with the one-year deferral for non-financial
assets and liabilities.  The adoption of SFAS No. 157 did not
have a material impact on our financial position, results of income, or cash
flows.  Beginning April 1, 2009, we expect to adopt the provisions for
non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities that are not required or
permitted to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis.  While we
are in the process of evaluating this standard with respect to its effect on
non- financial assets and liabilities, we have not yet determined the impact
that it will have on our financial statements upon full adoption in
2009.

Subsequent Events

On
October 30, 2008, Basic Earth Science Systems, Inc. (the "Company") announced
its plan to repurchase up to 500,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share of the Company. The plan allows purchases to be made from time to time in
the open market and through privately negotiated transactions in compliance with
Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"Exchange Act"). Rule 10b5-1 permits the implementation of a written plan for
repurchasing or selling Company stock at times when the Company is not in
possession of material, non-public information and allows issuers adopting such
plans to repurchase shares on a regular basis, regardless of any subsequent
material, non-public information it receives or the price of the stock at the
time of the purchase. Rule 10b-18 is a "safe harbor" rule, which allows issuers
to repurchase shares of their own stock in the public market, subject to
compliance with particular repurchase requirements. 

Subsequent
to the period ended September 30, 2008, we acquired a 1.5625% working interest
(1.250% net revenue interest) in a second Dunn County, horizontal Bakken well
operated by Marathon Oil Company. This well, the Steffan 14-22H, is currently
flowing approximately 300 barrels of oil per day on a 14/64" choke and is still
recovering completion fluids. We estimate that we spent approximately $100,000
on the acquisition of leasehold rights and subsequent drilling and completion
costs.

Item 2.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis and Plan of
Operation

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

Liquidity
Outlook. Our primary source of funding is the net cash flow from the sale
of our oil and gas production. The profitability and cash flow generated by our
operations in any particular accounting period will be directly related to:
(a) the volume of oil and gas produced and sold, (b) the average realized
prices for oil and gas sold, and (c) lifting costs. Assuming that oil
prices do not decline significantly from current levels, we believe the cash
generated from operations will enable us to meet our existing and normal
recurring obligations. In addition, as mentioned in the “Credit Line” section
below, we currently have $4,000,000 of unused borrowing capacity.

Working Capital.
At September 30, 2008, we had a working capital surplus of $5,461,000 (a
current ratio of 2.89:1) compared to a working capital surplus at March 31, 2008
of $3,168,000 (a current ratio of 1.79:1). The increase is a result of our
improved cash position due to increases in price and production of oil and gas
for the period ended September 30, 2008.

Cash Flow.
Net cash provided by operating activities increased 87% from $1,522,000
in the six months ended September 30, 2007 (“2007”) to $2,851,000 in the six
months ended September 30, 2008 (“2008”). This increase was primarily due to
increased oil and gas revenue, offset primarily by an increase in
depletion.

Net cash
used in investing activities increased 557% from $406,000 during 2007 to
$2,668,000 in the six months ended September 30, 2008. The difference relates
primarily to timing of cash payments relating to expenditures of the drilling
and completion of the new wells in DJ Basin of Colorado.

Credit
Line. Our current banking relationship, established in March 2002,
is with American National Bank (“the Bank”), located in Denver, Colorado.
Effective January 3, 2006 we amended the existing loan agreement to
increase the line of credit amount from $1,000,000 to $20,000,000 with a
concurrent borrowing base increase from $1,000,000 to $4,000,000. Effective
December 31, 2006 the loan agreement was amended again to extend the
maturity date of the credit agreement to December 31, 2008.

During
the year ended March 31, 2008, we utilized none of our credit facility. Our
effective annual interest rate at September 30, 2008 was WSJ prime plus 0.25%.
On September 30, 2008, we had no outstanding principal balance on the line of
credit with the entire $4,000,000 available for borrowing. If necessary, we may
borrow funds to reduce payables, finance re-completion or drilling efforts, fund
property acquisitions, or pursue other opportunities we cannot envision at this
time.
 
Capital
Expenditures

The
amounts presented herein may not be consistent with the amounts presented on the
consolidated statement of cash flows under investing activities for expenditures
on oil and gas property in that the amounts contained therein are presented on a
cash basis and not on an accrual basis.

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2008, we spent approximately $575,000 on various
projects.  When combined with first quarter investments, we have
deployed $1,215,000 through the first six months of the current fiscal
year.  This compares to $336,000 and $383,000 for the quarter and six
months ended September 30, 2007, respectively. Through the first six months of
fiscal 2008, approximately 78% of capital expenditures were dedicated to
drilling and completions, 13% was dedicated to preservation of expiring leases
and 9% was dedicated to the acquisition of producing properties.

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2008, we estimate that we spent 55% of our
drilling and completion dollars on our Antenna Federal development drilling
project in Weld County, 19% on drilling and completing the newest Marathon
operated well, the Steffan 14-22H, and 19% on the TR Madison Unit in Billings
County, North Dakota.  These projects were funded with internally
generated cash flow from operations.

Contemplated
Activities

We
anticipate pursuing the following activities during the remainder of fiscal
2009.

Panther
Energy Company, LLC. (Panther) is drilling the first of two wells on 13,000
gross acres in our Banks prospect in McKenzie County, North
Dakota.  Basic has a 6.5% (32.5% of 20%) carried working interest “to
the tanks” on the Banks acreage contributed to the spacing unit for the first
two wells and the right to participate for 6.5% interest on the Banks acreage
contributed to the spacing unit in subsequent wells.  As previously
disclosed, until Panther finishes these first two wells, Panther’s continued
involvement  or our timing to participate in subsequent wells remains
undetermined.

In
Montana, we and our 50% partner expect to drill a vertical Red River test on the
South Flat Lake prospect in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 or first quarter
of 2010, depending on weather and road conditions.  If successful, it
is possible that as many as 4 development wells could be drilled.  As
previously disclosed, efforts to commence drilling this fall were initially
hampered by the lack of available drilling rigs and more recently by the
scarcity of casing in the grades and weights that we require. We have purchased
casing that is expected to be delivered in late February which will free us to
begin drilling efforts then.  The initial well is expected to cost
approximately $1.35 million to drill.  While we now own and could
participate for our 50% interest in this prospect, if we and our partner sell a
portion of this prospect as intended, our interest would be proportionately
reduced. We expect to be the operator of this property.

At
present cash flow levels, and further extension of our available borrowing
capacity, we expect to have sufficient funds available for our share of any
additional acreage, seismic and/or drilling cost requirements that might arise
from these opportunities.  However, we may alter or vary all or part
of these planned capital expenditures based upon changes in circumstances,
unforeseen opportunities, inability to negotiate favorable acquisition, farmout
or joint venture terms, lack of cash flow, lack of additional funding, if
necessary, and/or other events which we are not able to anticipate.

We are
continually evaluating other drilling and acquisition opportunities for possible
participation. Typically, at any one time, several opportunities are in various
stages of due diligence. Our policy is to not disclose the specifics of a
project or prospect, nor to speculate on such ventures, until such time as those
various opportunities are finalized and undertaken. We caution that the absence
of news and/or press releases should not be interpreted as a lack of development
or activity.

Divestitures/Abandonments

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2008 we completed plugging one operated well
which began in the prior quarter.  
 
Results of Operations

Three
Months Ended September 30, 2008 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30,
2007

Overview.
Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2008 was
$946,000 compared to net income of $430,000, as restated, for the three months
ended September 30, 2007, an increase of 120%.

Revenues.
Oil and gas sales revenue increased $908,000 (51%) in 2008 from 2007. Oil sales
revenue increased $617,000 (38%), and gas sales revenue increased $291,000
(169%) in 2008 from 2007.  These increases resulted largely from the
overall increased price during the quarter, as well as the recently completed DJ
wells.

Volumes and
Prices. Oil sales volumes decreased 15%, from 22,800 barrels in 2007 to
19,400 barrels in 2008 while there was an increase of 62% in the average price
per barrel from $70.95 in 2007 to $115.09 in 2008. The drop in oil sales volume
is attributed primarily to a reversal of over accrued volume estimates made in
the previous quarter that were associated with our new wells on our Antenna
Federal property in Weld County, Colorado.  Gas sales volume increased
28% from 30.4 million cubic feet (MMcf) in 2007 to 38.8 MMcf in 2008, while
the average price per Mcf increased 111%, from $5.69 in 2007 to $11.98 in 2008.
The increase in gas sales volume is primarily due to bringing back online wells
in the Antenna Federal property in Weld County, Colorado, as well as the
production of new wells in the same property. On an equivalent barrel
(BOE) basis, sales volume decreased 7% from 27,800 BOE in 2007 to 25,900
BOE in 2008.

Expenses.
Oil and gas production expense increased $100,000 (22%) in 2008 over 2007. Oil
and gas production expense is comprised of two components: routine lease
operating expenses and workovers. Routine expenses typically include such items
as daily well maintenance, utilities, fuel, water disposal, minor surface
equipment repairs, and marketing and transportation costs. Workovers, on the
other hand, which primarily include downhole repairs, are generally random in
nature. Although workovers are expected, they can be much more frequent in some
wells than others and their cost can be significant. Therefore, workovers
account for more dramatic fluctuations in oil and gas production expense from
period to period.

Routine
lease operating expense increased $95,000 (24%) from $390,000 in 2007 to
$485,000 in 2008 while workover expense increased $5,000 (7%) from $73,000 in
2007 to $78,000 in 2008. Routine lease operating expense per BOE increased 34%
from $14.05 in 2007 to $18.73 in 2008 while workover expense per BOE increased
16% from $2.61 in 2007 to $3.01 in 2008.

Production
taxes, which are generally a percentage of sales revenue, increased $59,000
(38%) in 2008 over 2007 primarily due to the influence of higher oil prices and
understandably higher gross revenues. Production taxes, as a percent of sales
revenue decreased from 9% in 2007 to 8% in 2008.  The overall lifting
cost (oil and gas production expense and production taxes) per BOE increased 35%
from $22.26 in 2007 to $30.07 in 2008.
 
Depreciation
and depletion expense increased $18,000 (10%) in 2008 over 2007 as a result of
an increase in the full cost pool depletable base.
 
General
and administrative expense increased $100,000 (65%) in 2008 over 2007. These
increases were primarily the result of increased expenditures attributable to
the restatement of our financials, along with increases in consulting fees, and
to a less extent, increases in the number of office
personnel.  G&A expense per BOE increased 77% from $5.57 in 2007
to $9.85 in 2008. As a percent of total sales revenue, G&A expense remained
consistent at 9% from 2007 to 2008.

Six Months Ended September 30,
2008 Compared to Six Months Ended September 30, 2007

Overview.
Net income for the six months ended September 30, 2008 was
$2,326,000 compared to net income of $717,000 as restated for the six months
ended September 30, 2007, an increase of 224%.

Revenues.
Oil and gas sales revenue increased $2,617,000 (77%) in 2008 from 2007. Oil
sales revenue increased $2,137,000 (72%). Gas sales revenue increased $481,000
(114%) in 2008 from 2007. These increases resulted largely from the increased
price during the past six months.

Volumes and
Prices. Oil sales volumes declined 4%, from 45,100 barrels in 2007 to
43,300 barrels in 2008 while there was a 79% increase in the average price per
barrel from $65.92 in 2007 to $117.86 in 2008. Gas sales volume increased 27%,
from 64.6 million cubic feet (MMcf) in 2007 to 81.9 MMcf in 2008, while the
average price per Mcf rose 68%, from $6.54 in 2007 to $10.98 in 2008. The
increase in gas sales volume is primarily due to production brought online from
our 16-well drilling program in Weld County, Colorado. On an equivalent barrel
(BOE) basis, sales volume increased 2% from 55,800 BOE in 2007 to 57,000
BOE in 2008.

Expenses.
Oil and gas production expense increased $172,000 (18%) in 2008 over 2007. Oil
and gas production expense is comprised of two components: routine lease
operating expenses and workovers. Routine expenses typically include such items
as daily well maintenance, utilities, fuel, water disposal and minor surface
equipment repairs. Workovers, on the other hand, which primarily include
downhole repairs, are generally random in nature. Although workovers are
expected, they can be much more frequent in some wells than others and their
cost can be significant. Therefore, workovers account for more dramatic
fluctuations in oil and gas production expense from period to
period.

Routine
lease operating expense increased $154,000 (20%) from $784,000 in 2007 to
$938,000 in 2008 while workover expense increased $18,000 (10%) from $173,000 in
2007 to $191,000 in 2008. Routine lease operating expense per BOE increased 17%
from $14.05 in 2007 to $16.46 in 2008 while workover expense per BOE rose 8%
from $3.10 in 2007 to $3.35 in 2008.

Production
taxes, which are generally a percentage of sales revenue, increased $215,000
(76%) in 2008 over 2007. Production taxes, as a percent of sales revenue
remained consistent at 8% from 2007 to 2008. The overall lifting cost (oil and
gas production expense and production taxes) per BOE increased 28% from $22.22
in 2007 to $28.54 in 2008.

Depreciation
and depletion expense increased $62,000 (17%) in 2008 over 2007 as a result of
an increase in the full cost pool depletable base.

General
and administrative expense increased $235,000 (73%) in 2008 over 2007. These
increases were primarily the result of increased expenditures attributable to
the restatement of our financials, along with increases in consulting fees, and
to a less extent, increases in the number of office personnel. G&A expense
per BOE increased 69% from $5.79 in 2007 to $9.79 in 2008. As a percent of total
sales revenue, G&A expense declined from 10% in 2007 to 9% in
2008.

Income Tax
Expense. For the six months ended September 30, 2008 we recorded income
tax expense of $933,000. This includes a current year expense of $368,000 and a
deferred tax provision of $565,000.  Our effective income tax rate
decreased from 51.3% for the six months ended September 30, 2007 to 28.6% for
2008. Our effective income tax rate was lower for 2008 primarily due to an
increase in estimated deductions for statutory depletion.

3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk

As a
crude oil and natural gas producer, our revenue, cash flow from operations,
other income and profitability, reserve values, access to capital and future
rate of growth are substantially dependent upon the prevailing prices of crude
oil and natural gas. Declines in commodity prices will materially adversely
affect our financial condition, liquidity, ability to obtain financing and
operating results. Lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of crude oil and
natural gas that we can produce economically. Prevailing prices for such
commodities are subject to wide fluctuation in response to relatively minor
changes in supply and demand and a variety of additional factors beyond our
control, such as global, political and economic conditions. Historically, prices
received for crude oil and natural gas production have been volatile and
unpredictable, and such volatility is expected to continue. Most of our
production is sold at market prices. Generally, if the commodity indexes fall,
the price that we receive for our production will also decline. Therefore, the
amount of revenue that we realize is to a large extent determined by factors
beyond our control.

The
Company maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures that are
designed for the purpose of ensuring that information required to be disclosed
in its SEC reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information
is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the Chief
Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosures.

For the
quarter ended September 30, 2008 we carried out an evaluation, under the
supervision and with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer
and Principal Accounting Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and
operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that
evaluation, it was concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and
procedures are effective for the purposes discussed above.

There
have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
that occurred during the Company’s quarter ended September 30, 2008 that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting.
