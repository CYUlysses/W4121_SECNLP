FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS

This
Current Report on Form 10-Q, including information incorporated herein by
reference, contains forward-looking statements as defined in the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The use of any statements containing
the words "anticipate," "intend," "believe," "estimate," "project," "expect,"
"plan," "should" or similar expressions are intended to identify such
statements. Forward-looking statements relate to, among other
things:
 
•      our
future financial position, including anticipated liquidity;
•      our
ability to satisfy obligations from cash generated from operations;

•      amounts
and nature of future capital expenditures;
•      acquisitions
and other business opportunities;
•      operating
costs and other expenses;
•      wells
expected to be drilled;
•      asset
retirement obligations; and
•      estimates
of proved oil and natural gas reserves, deferred tax liabilities, and depletion
rates.
•      our
ability to meet additional acreage, seismic and/or drilling cost requirements
arising from acquisition opportunities;

  
Factors
that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations
include, among others, such things as:

•      oil
and natural gas prices;
•      our
ability to replace oil and natural gas reserves;
•      loss
of senior management or technical personnel;
•      inaccuracy
in reserve estimates and expected production rates;
•      exploitation,
development and exploration results;
•      the actual costs related to
asset retirement obligations, and whether or not those retirements actually
occur in the future;


•      a
lack of available capital and financing;
•      the
potential unavailability of drilling rigs and other field equipment and
services;
•      the
existence of unanticipated liabilities or problems relating to acquired
properties;
•      general
economic, market or business conditions;
•      factors
affecting the nature and timing of our capital expenditures, including the
availability of service contractors and equipment,


•      permitting
issues, workovers, and weather;

•      the
impact and costs related to compliance with or changes in laws or regulations
governing our oil and natural gas operations;



•      environmental
liabilities;
•      acquisitions
and other business opportunities (or the lack thereof) that may be presented to
and pursued by us;
•      competition
for available properties and the effect of such competition on the price of
those properties;
•      risk
factors discussed in this report and those risk factors discussed in the “Risk
Factors” section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
     fiscal
year ended March 31, 2009.
•      other
factors, many of which are beyond our control.

Although
we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements
are reasonable, those expectations may prove to be
incorrect.  Disclosure of important factors that could cause actual
results to differ materially from our expectations, or cautionary statements,
are included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March
31, 2009, under the heading "Risk Factors", and elsewhere in this report,
including, without limitation, in conjunction with the forward-looking
statements.  All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date
made.  All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements
attributable to us, or persons acting on our behalf, are expressly qualified in
their entirety by the cautionary statements.  Except as required by
law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to
reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect
the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or
circumstances.

Basic Earth Science Systems, Inc.
Notes
to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements
December
31, 2009

1.
Presentation of Consolidated Financial Statements

The
accompanying interim financial statements of Basic Earth Science Systems, Inc.
(sometimes referred to as “the Company” “we” “our” or “us”) are unaudited.
However, in the opinion of management, the interim data includes any applicable
adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim
period.

At the
directive of the Securities and Exchange Commission to use “plain English” in
public filings, the Company will use such terms as “we”, “our”, “us” or “the
Company” in place of Basic Earth Science Systems, Inc.  When such
terms are used in this manner throughout this document they are in reference
only to the corporation, Basic Earth Science Systems, Inc. and its subsidiaries,
and are not used in reference to the board of directors, corporate officers,
management, or any individual employee or group of employees.

The
financial statements included herein have been prepared by the Company pursuant
to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been
condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. We believe the
disclosures made are adequate to make the information not misleading and suggest
that these financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial
statements and related notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended March 31, 2009 and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for
the quarters ended September 30, 2009 and June 30, 2009.

For the
period ended December 31, 2009 through February 12, 2010, the filing date of
this report, we determined that there were no subsequent events to recognize or
disclose in these consolidated financial statements which would either impact
the results reflected in this report or the Company’s results going
forward.

Organization and
Nature of Operations. Basic Earth Science Systems, Inc. was originally
organized in July 1969 and had its first public offering in 1980. We are
principally engaged in the acquisition, exploitation, development, operation and
production of crude oil and natural gas. Our primary areas of operation are the
Williston basin in North Dakota and Montana, south Texas and the
Denver-Julesburg basin in Colorado.

Principles of
Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include our accounts
and those of our wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated.  The Company does not
have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements or any unconsolidated special
purpose entities.

2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting
Pronouncements

Use of Estimates.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the actual amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the actual amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. We base these estimates on assumptions that we understand are
reasonable under the circumstances. The estimated results that are produced by
this effort will differ under different assumptions or conditions.  We
understand that these estimates are necessary, and we caution that actual
results could vary significantly from the estimated amounts for the current and
future periods. There are many factors, including global events, which may
influence the production, processing, marketing, and valuation of crude oil and
natural gas. A reduction in the valuation of oil and gas properties resulting
from declining prices or production could adversely impact depletion rates and
ceiling test limitations. We understand the following accounting policies and
estimates are necessary in the preparation of our consolidated financial
statements: the carrying value of our oil and gas property, the accounting for
oil and gas reserves, the estimate of our asset retirement obligations, the
estimate of our income tax assets and liabilities and estimates of accrued
quantities and prices in our oil and gas receivable.

Table of Contents 


Oil and Gas
Reserves. Oil and gas reserves represent theoretical, estimated
quantities of crude oil and natural gas which geological and engineering data
estimate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known
reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. There are numerous
uncertainties inherent in estimating oil and gas reserves and their values,
including many factors beyond our control. Accordingly, reserve estimates are
different from the future quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately
recovered and the corresponding lifting costs associated with the recovery of
these reserves. As of our year end, March 31, 2009, ninety-eight percent of our
reported oil and gas reserves are based on estimates prepared by Ryder Scott
Company, L.P, a nationally recognized, independent petroleum engineering firm.
The remaining two percent of our oil and gas reserves were prepared by our
technical in-house staff.

Each
quarter, we update reserve estimates by substituting the prices we would have
received at quarter-end for the year-end prices that were used by our
independent petroleum engineers.  In conducting this “re-pricing” no
changes are made to the decline rates, tax rates or lifting costs used by our
independent petroleum engineers.  The determinations of depletion
expense, as well as the results of ceiling tests and corresponding write-downs,
if any, are highly dependent on these reserve and quarterly “re-pricing”
estimates.

Oil and Gas
Sales. We derive revenue primarily from the sale of produced natural gas
and crude oil. We report revenue on a gross basis for the amounts received
before taking into account production taxes and transportation costs, which are
reported as separate expenses. Revenue is recorded using the sales method, which
occurs in the month production is delivered to the purchaser, at which time
title changes hands. Payment is generally received between 30 and 90 days
after the date of production. We make estimates of the amount of production
delivered to purchasers and the prices we will receive. We use our knowledge of
our properties, their historical performance, NYMEX and local spot market
prices, and other factors as the basis for these estimates. Variances between
estimates and the actual amounts received are recorded when payment is received,
or when better information is available.

Oil and Gas
Property. We follow the full cost method of accounting for our oil and
gas property. Accordingly, all costs associated with the acquisition,
exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized. These
capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test that limits such pooled costs to
the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved
oil and gas reserves using current prices and costs discounted at
10 percent plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties less
any associated tax effects. If the full cost pool of capitalized oil and gas
property costs exceeds the ceiling, we will record a ceiling test write-down to
the extent of such excess. This write-down is a non-cash charge to earnings. If
required, it reduces earnings and impacts stockholders’ equity in the period of
occurrence. The write-down may not be reversed in future periods, even though
higher oil and gas prices in the future may subsequently and significantly
increase reserve estimates in future periods.  As of the balance sheet
date, our capitalized costs did not exceed the ceiling test limit.

Cash and Cash
Equivalents. For purposes of the Consolidated Balance Sheets and
Statements of Cash Flows, we consider all highly liquid investments with a
maturity of ninety days or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The
carrying amount of cash equivalents approximates fair value because of the
short-term maturity of those instruments. During the period and at the balance
sheet date, balances of cash and cash equivalents exceeded the federally insured
limit.

Support Equipment
and Other. Support equipment (including such items as vehicles, office
furniture and equipment and well servicing equipment) is stated at cost.
Depreciation of support equipment and other property is computed using the
straight-line method over periods ranging from five to seven years.

Long-Lived
Assets. We regularly evaluate all long-lived assets for possible
impairment. Assets are reported at the lower of cost or their estimated
recoverable amounts. During 2009 there was no impairment recorded for long-lived
assets, compared to $2,694,000 for 2008.

Fair Value
Measurements. Effective April 1, 2009, we adopted the provisions for
nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are not required to be measured at fair
value on a recurring basis, which include, among others, those assets measured
at fair value for impairment assessment and asset retirement obligations
initially measured at fair value. Fair value used in the initial recognition of
asset retirement obligations is determined based on the present value of
expected future dismantlement costs incorporating our estimate of inputs used by
industry participants when valuing similar liabilities. Accordingly, the fair
value is based on unobservable pricing inputs and therefore, is considered a
level 3 value input in the fair value hierarchy.

Asset Retirement
Obligations. We have obligations related to the plugging and abandonment
of our oil and gas wells. We estimate the future cost of these obligations,
discount this cost to its present value, and record a corresponding asset and
liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The values ultimately derived are
based on numerous and significant estimates, including the ultimate expected
cost of the obligation, the expected future date of the required cash
expenditures and inflation rates. The nature of these estimates requires us to
make judgments based on historical experience and future expectations related to
timing. We review the estimate of our future asset retirement obligations
quarterly. These quarterly reviews may require revisions to these estimates
based on such things as changes to cost estimates or the timing of future cash
outlays. Any such changes that result in upward or downward revisions in the
estimated obligation will result in an adjustment to the related capitalized
asset and corresponding liability on a prospective basis.
 
We
recognize two components on our consolidated statement of operations; accretion
of asset retirement obligations and asset retirement
expense.  Accretion of asset retirement obligation reflects the
periodic accretion of the present value of future plugging and abandonment
costs.  Asset retirement expense reflects the actual current period
gains and losses on plugging and abandonment costs relative to previously
estimated future costs. We have closed gains and losses on asset
retirements to the consolidated statement of operations as a component of asset
retirement expense.

The
information below reconciles the value of the asset retirement obligation for
the period presented.  This includes a short term obligation of
$127,000, which is carried within the accrued liabilities line item of the
balance sheet.

Commitments.  We
currently office in a 4,000 square foot office space located in downtown Denver,
Colorado, and are committed to a total of $281,000 plus maintenance fees for the
five-year lease term ending April 1, 2013.  We have no off
balance sheet transactions or arrangements.

Income Taxes.
We account for income taxes with deferred tax liabilities and assets
which are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial
statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in
effect for the year in which the differences are expected to
reverse.

Projections
of future income taxes and their timing require significant estimates with
respect to future operating results. Accordingly, the net deferred tax liability
is continually re-evaluated and numerous estimates are revised over time. As
such, the net deferred tax liability may change significantly as more
information and data is gathered with respect to such events as changes in
commodity prices, their effect on the estimate of oil and gas reserves and the
depletion of these long-lived reserves.

We are
subject to U.S. federal income tax and income tax from multiple state
jurisdictions. The tax years remaining subject to examination by tax authorities
are fiscal years 2006 through 2008. We recognize interest and penalties related
to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. As of December 31, 2009, we
made no provisions for interest or penalties related to uncertain tax
positions.

Earnings Per
Share. Our earnings per share (EPS) is computed by dividing net income by
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted
EPS is calculated by dividing net income by the diluted weighted average number
of common shares. The diluted weighted average number of common shares is
computed using the treasury stock method for common stock that may be issued for
outstanding stock options.  As of the balance sheet date no dilutive
securities were outstanding.
 
Reclassifications.
Certain prior year amounts were reclassified to conform to current year
presentation. Such reclassifications had no effect on net income.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

In
October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
authoritative guidance that amends existing guidance for identifying separate
deliverables in a revenue-generating transaction where multiple deliverables
exist, and provides guidance for allocating and recognizing revenue based on
those separate deliverables. The guidance is expected to result in more
multiple-deliverable arrangements being separable than under current guidance.
This guidance is effective for the Company beginning on April 1, 2011 and is
required to be applied prospectively to new or significantly modified revenue
arrangements. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on
our consolidated financial statements or results of operations.

In June
2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Codification, “Accounting Standards
Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles”
(Codification) which will become the source of authoritative U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles (GAAP) recognized by the FASB to be applied by
nongovernmental entities. Rules and interpretive releases of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) under authority of federal securities laws are also
sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. On the effective date of this
Statement, the Codification will supersede all then-existing non-SEC accounting
and reporting standards. All other non-grandfathered non-SEC accounting
literature not included in the Codification will become non-authoritative. 
This Statement is effective for financial statements issued for interim and
annual periods ended after September 15, 2009.  The adoption of the
Codification did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
statements or results of operations.

In
June 2009, the FASB issued guidance related to subsequent events which
incorporates the guidance contained in the auditing standards literature into
authoritative accounting literature. It also requires entities to disclose the
date through which they have evaluated subsequent events and whether the date
corresponds with the release of their financial statements. The new guidance is
effective for all interim and annual periods ended after June 15, 2009. The
Company adopted the guidance upon its issuance and it had no material impact on
our consolidated financial statements.

On
April 29, 2009, the FASB issued guidance related to financial instruments,
which requires publicly-traded companies to provide disclosures on the fair
value of financial instruments in interim financial statements, and is effective
for interim periods ended after June 15, 2009. We have adopted these new
provisions, which did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
financial statements or results of operations.

On
April 1, 2009, the FASB issued guidance related to business combinations,
which addresses application issues associated with initial recognition and
measurement, subsequent measurement and accounting and disclosure of assets and
liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination, including the
treatment of contingent consideration, acquisition costs, research and
development assets and restructuring costs. In addition, changes in deferred tax
asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties in a business
combination after the measurement period will impact income taxes. The new
guidance is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date
is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on
or after December 15, 2008. We will apply the new provisions to future
acquisitions.

Table of Contents 


In
December 2008, the SEC announced final approval of new requirements for
reporting oil and gas reserves. Among the changes to the disclosure requirements
is a broader definition of reserves, which allows reporting of probable and
possible reserves, in addition to consideration of new technologies and
non-traditional resources. In addition, oil and gas reserves will be reported
using an average price based on the prior 12-month period, rather than year-end
prices, and allow companies to disclose their probable and possible reserves to
investors. The new rules are expected to be effective for years ending on or
after December 31, 2009. The Company is in the process of evaluating the
effect of these new requirements, and has not yet determined the impact that it
will have on its financial statements upon full adoption on March 31,
2010.

In
September 2006, the FASB issued guidance related to fair value measurements
and disclosures, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring
fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and
expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The new guidance is effective
for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. In February 2008,
the FASB proposed a one year deferral of the implementation for non-financial
assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a
nonrecurring basis (less frequent than annually). On April 1, 2008, we
adopted the new guidance with the one-year deferral for non-financial assets and
liabilities. The adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on
our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Beginning
April 1, 2009, we have adopted the provisions for non-financial assets and
non-financial liabilities that are not required or permitted to be measured at
fair value on a recurring basis. The adoption did not have a material impact on
our financial statements.

Item 2.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations
 
The
following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended March 31, 2009, as well as the financial statements and related notes and
other information appearing elsewhere in this report.

As a
crude oil and natural gas producer, our revenue, cash flow from operations,
other income and profitability, reserve values, access to capital and future
rate of growth are substantially dependent upon the prevailing prices of crude
oil and natural gas. Declines in commodity prices will materially and adversely
affect our financial condition, liquidity, ability to obtain financing and
operating results. Lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of crude oil and
natural gas that we can produce economically. Prevailing prices for such
commodities are subject to wide fluctuation in response to relatively minor
changes in supply and demand and a variety of additional factors beyond our
control, such as global, political and economic conditions. Historically, prices
received for crude oil and natural gas production have been volatile and
unpredictable, and such volatility is expected to continue. Most of our
production is sold at market prices. Generally, if the commodity indexes fall,
the price that we receive for our production will also decline. Therefore, the
amount of revenue that we realize is to a large extent determined by factors
beyond our control.
 
Liquidity
and Capital Resources

Liquidity
Outlook. Our primary source of funding is the net cash flow from the sale
of our oil and gas production. The profitability and cash flow generated by our
operations in any particular accounting period will be directly related to:
(a) the volume of oil and gas produced and sold, (b) the average realized
prices for oil and gas sold and (c) lifting costs. Assuming that oil prices
do not decline from current levels, we believe the cash generated from
operations, along with existing cash balances, will enable us to meet our
existing and normal recurring obligations during the next year and
beyond.

Working Capital.
At December 31, 2009, we had a working capital surplus of $5,010,000 (a
current ratio of 3.42:1) compared to a working capital surplus at March 31, 2009
of $5,045,000 (a current ratio of 4.62:1). The decrease in current ratio is
largely a result of the timing between payments made for payables and cash
received for revenue.

Cash Flow.
Net cash provided by operating activities decreased 40.2% from $4,344,000
in the nine months ended December 31, 2008 (“2008”) to $2,597,000 in the nine
months ended December 31, 2009 (“2009”) primarily due to decreased oil and gas
commodity prices.   Our net income was reduced by non-cash impairment
charges (for 2008) and non-cash depletion expense.

Net cash
used in investing activities decreased 60.0% from $3,587,000 in the nine months
ended December 31, 2008 to $1,435,000 in the nine months ended December 31,
2009. The difference relates primarily to significantly more expenditures made
during the prior year on the DJ Basin wells in Colorado.

Net cash
used in financing activities increased 1,220.0% from $15,000 in the nine months
ended December 31, 2008 to $198,000 in the nine months ended
December 31, 2009.   Cash used in financing activities
related to the stock buyback program adopted in October 2008.

Credit
Line. Our current banking relationship, established in March 2002,
is with American National Bank (“the Bank”), located in Denver, Colorado.
Subject to evaluation every six months, the line of credit amount was set at $20
million with a concurrent borrowing base of $4 million. Effective
December 31, 2008, the loan agreement was amended to extend the maturity
date of the credit agreement to December 31, 2010.  We renewed
the line with an interest rate of prime plus 0.25% or 6.5% whichever is
higher.  During the year ended March 31, 2009 and for the nine
months ended December 31, 2009, we did not utilize our credit
facility.  The loan contains several covenant
restrictions.   At December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with all
covenants.  This line may be used for purposes of borrowing funds to
reduce payables, finance re-completion or drilling efforts, fund property
acquisitions or pursue other opportunities that might arise.

Capital
Expenditures

The
amounts presented herein are presented on an accrual basis, and as such may not
be consistent with the amounts presented on the consolidated statement of cash
flows under investing activities for expenditures on oil and gas property, which
are presented on a cash basis.

During
the quarter ended December 31, 2009, we spent approximately $1,354,000 on
various projects.   When combined with first and second quarter
investments, we have deployed $1,826,000 through the first nine months of the
current fiscal year.  This compares to $353,000 and $1,568,000 for the
quarter and nine months ended December 31, 2008. During the quarter ended
December 31, 2009, 88% of capital expenditures were dedicated to drilling and
completions.  We spent approximately 32% of our capital expenditures
amount on drilling and plugging the Crown 41-31 well in Sheridan County,
Montana, 29% on drilling and completion efforts on the Mondak Federal 4-14H well
in McKenzie County, North Dakota, 16% in completion costs on the Halvorsen
31X-36, 5% in completion costs on the Kings Canyon 21-27H well in McKenzie
County, North Dakota, 4% on recompletion of the Guenther 1-8 in Sheridan County,
Montana, and 2% on completion efforts of the Paulson 44-9H in Dunn County, North
Dakota.  These projects were funded with cash flow from
operations.
 
At
present cash levels, and with the extension of our available borrowing capacity,
we expect to have sufficient funds available for our share of any additional
acreage, seismic and/or drilling cost requirements that might arise from these
opportunities.  We may alter or vary all or part of any planned
capital expenditures for reasons including but not limited to: changes in
circumstances, unforeseen opportunities, inability to negotiate favorable
acquisition, farmout or joint venture terms, lack of cash flow and lack of
additional funding.

We
currently have no capital expenditure commitments.  We are continually
evaluating drilling and acquisition opportunities for possible participation.
Typically, at any one time, several opportunities are in various stages of due
diligence. Our policy is to not disclose the specifics of a project or prospect,
nor to speculate on such ventures, until such time as those various
opportunities are finalized and undertaken. We caution that the absence of news
and/or press releases should not be interpreted as a lack of development or
activity.

Divestitures/Abandonments

During
the quarter ended December 31, 2009, we plugged two wells.

Three
Months Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Three Months Ended December 31,
2008

Revenues.
Oil and gas sales revenue decreased $147,000 (6.8%) in 2009 from 2008 due to
lower realized oil and gas prices. Oil sales revenue increased $291,000 (18.8%),
and gas sales revenue decreased $438,000 (71.6%) in 2009 from
2008. 

Volumes and
Prices. Oil sales volume decreased 2.7%, from 29,400 barrels in 2008 to
28,606 barrels in 2009 while there was an increase of 22.0% in the average price
per barrel from $52.80 in 2008 to $64.43 in 2009. Gas sales volume
increased 19.6% from 65,100 thousand cubic feet (Mcf) in 2008 to 77,866 Mcf in
2009, while the average price per Mcf decreased 21.9%, from $2.86 in 2008 to
$2.23 in 2009.

The
increase in gas sales volume, is primarily due to adjustments made during the
quarter ended December 31, 2009, to our revenues, sales volumes, sales prices
and severance taxes following the receipt of higher production and sales volume
information related to the Antenna Federal property in Weld County,
Colorado.  Most of the Company’s gas sales are from our non-operated
interest in the Antenna Federal property in Weld County,
Colorado.  The Company had estimated gas sales on this property based
on the information available at the time and the Company’s experience in the
area.  We have recently received actual sales volumes and related
information from the operator, which are significantly higher than the sales
volumes and related information previously reported to, and accrued by, the
Company in prior periods.  The incorporation of this information
resulted in higher sales volumes, sales prices and severance taxes for the
current quarter.   Due to the adjustments made during the quarter
ended December 31, 2009, for updated sales volumes and related information
received from the operator of the Antenna Federal property, the higher sales
volumes for the quarter ended December 31, 2009, are not representative of
actual sales volume for this quarter and should not be used to predict future
production or sales volumes.  In addition, production taxes as a
percentage of sales, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of
sales and any metric whose denominator is related to sales volumes is likely
understated.  On an equivalent barrel of oil (BOE) basis, sales
volume increased 3.2% from 40,300 BOE in 2008 to 41,584 BOE in
2009.

Expenses.
Oil and gas production expense decreased $5,000 (0.7%) in 2009 over 2008,
primarily due to workover expense decreasing $92,000 (46.0%) from $200,000 in
2008 to $108,000 in 2009 and routine lease operating expense increasing by
$87,000 (16.0%) from $543,000 in 2008 to $630,000 in 2009.  Routine
lease operating expense per BOE increased 12.24% from $13.47 in 2008 to $15.15
in 2009 due to the overall increase in gas volumes and corresponding
transportation and marketing costs, while workover expense per BOE decreased
47.7% from $4.96 in 2008 to $2.60 in 2009 due to fewer workover operations in
2009.

Production
taxes, which are generally a percentage of sales revenue, decreased $120,000
(100.0%) in 2009 compared to 2008. Production taxes, as a percent of sales
revenue decreased from 5.4% in 2008 to 0.0% in 2009, due to adjustments made
during the quarter ended December 31, 2009 for updated sales volumes and
production tax information received from the operator of the Antenna Federal
property.  See
“Volumes and Prices” above.  The
overall lifting cost (oil and gas production expense and production taxes) per
BOE decreased 17.1% from $21.41 in 2008 to $17.75 in 2009.
 
Depreciation,
depletion and amortization expense decreased $180,000 (32.3%) in 2009 compared
to 2008 as a result of the change in oil and gas volumes as mentioned
above.    

General
and administrative expense increased $152,000 (40.6%) in 2009 over
2008.  Of the increase, approximately 44.9% related to bonus expense,
44.3% to professional services (audit, legal and consulting fees), 24.7% to
increased proxy statement and stockholder meeting expenses, and other categories
increased less than 10%.  These expenses were offset during the period
by a decrease in bad debt expense of 19.6%.   G&A expense per
BOE increased 36.3% from $9.28 in 2008 to $12.65 in 2009. As a percent of total
sales revenue, G&A expense increased from 17.0% in 2008 to 25.9% in
2009.

Income Tax
Expense (Benefit). For the three months ended December 31, 2009, we
recorded an income tax expense of $47,000. This amount consists of a current tax
benefit of $55,000 which was reduced by a deferred tax expense of
$102,000.  Our effective income tax rate was 13.72% for the three
months ended 2009.

Nine
Months Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Nine Months Ended December 31,
2008

Revenues.
Oil and gas sales revenue decreased $2,686,000 (32.9%) in 2009 from 2008 due to
lower realized oil and gas prices. Oil sales revenue decreased $1,834,000
(27.5%), and gas sales revenue decreased $852,000 (56.2%) in 2009 from
2008. 

Volumes and
Prices. Oil sales volume increased 10.3%, from 72,700 barrels in 2008 to
80,215 barrels in 2009 while there was a decrease of 34.3% in the average price
per barrel from $91.57 in 2008 to $60.14 in 2009. Gas sales volume
increased 34.1% from 147,000 thousand cubic feet (Mcf) in 2008 to 197,192 Mcf in
2009, while the average price per Mcf decreased 54.5%, from $7.39 in 2008 to
$3.36 in 2009.

The
increase in gas sales volume, and to a lesser extent the increase in oil sales
volume, is primarily due to adjustments made during the nine months ended
December 31, 2009, to our revenues, sales volumes, sales prices and severance
taxes following the receipt of higher production and sales volume information
related to the Antenna Federal property in Weld County,
Colorado.  Most of the Company’s gas sales are from our non-operated
interest in the Antenna Federal property in Weld County,
Colorado.  The Company had estimated gas sales on this property based
on the information available at the time and the Company’s experience in the
area.  We have recently received actual sales volumes and related
information from the operator, which are significantly higher than the sales
volumes and related information previously reported to, and accrued by, the
Company in prior periods.  The incorporation of this information
resulted in higher sales volumes, sales prices and severance taxes for the
current period.  Due to the adjustments made during the nine months
ended December 31, 2009, for updated sales volume information received from the
operator of the Antenna Federal property, the higher sales volumes for the nine
months ended December 31, 2009, are not representative of actual sales volume
for this period and should not be used to predict future production or sales
volumes.  In addition, production taxes as a percentage of sales,
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales and any metric
whose denominator is related to sales volumes is likely
understated.  On an equivalent barrel of oil (BOE) basis, sales
volume increased 16.3% from 97,200 BOE in the nine months ended December 31,
2008 to 113,080 BOE in the nine months ended December 31, 2009.

Expenses.
Oil and gas production expense decreased $114,000 (6.1%) in 2009 over 2008,
primarily due to workover expenses declining by $111,000 (28.4%) from $391,000
in 2008 to $280,000 in 2009 and routine lease operating expense decreasing by
$3,000 (0.2%) from $1,481,000 in 2008 to $1,478,000 in 2009.  Routine lease
operating expense per BOE decreased 14.2% from $15.24 in 2008 to $13.07 in 2009
due to the overall decrease in costs following the decline in oil and gas
prices, while workover expense per BOE decreased 38.4% from $4.02 in 2008 to
$2.48 in 2009 due to fewer workover operations in 2009.

Production
taxes, which are generally a percentage of sales revenue, decreased $233,000
(37.7%) in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to the overall decline of oil
prices. Production taxes, as a percent of sales revenue decreased from 7.5% in
2008 to 7.0% in 2009, due to the adjustments made during the nine months ended
December 31, 2009 for updated sales volumes and production tax information
received from the operator of the Antenna Federal property.  See “Volumes and Prices” above.  The
overall lifting cost (oil and gas production expense and production taxes) per
BOE decreased 26.0% from $25.62 in 2008 to $18.95 in 2009.
 
Depreciation,
depletion and amortization expense decreased $24,000 (2.5%) in 2009 compared to
2008 as a result of the change in oil and gas volumes mentioned
above.

General
and administrative expense increased $421,000 (45.2%) in 2009 over
2008.  Of the increase, approximately 55.0% related to professional
services (audit, legal and consulting fees), 21.9% in bonus expense, 12.8% in
increased proxy statement and stockholder meeting expenses, and other categories
increased less than 10%.  G&A expense per BOE increased 24.8% from
$9.59 in 2008 to $11.96 in 2009. As a percent of total sales revenue, G&A
expense increased from 11.3% in 2008 to 24.5% in 2009.

Income Tax
Expense (Benefit). For the nine months ended December 31, 2009 we
recorded an income tax expense of $136,000. This includes current period expense
of $6,000 and a deferred tax expense of $130,000.  Our effective
income tax rate decreased from 15.96% for the nine months ended December 31,
2008 to 14.3% for the nine months ended 2009.  Our effective income
tax rate was lower for 2009 primarily due to an increase in estimated deductions
for statutory depletion.

Risk

Item 4T.
Controls and Procedures

The
Company maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the “Exchange Act”), for the purpose of providing reasonable assurance
that information required to be disclosed in its SEC reports is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SEC’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the
Principal Accounting Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosures.

For the
quarter ended December 31, 2009, we evaluated under the supervision and with the
participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Principal Accounting
Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, we concluded
that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective for the
purposes discussed above.

There
have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
that occurred during the Company’s quarter ended December 31, 2009 that have
materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

On
      October 22, 2008, the Company’s board of directors authorized a stock
      buyback program for the Company to repurchase up to 500,000 shares of its
      common stock for a period of up to 18 months. The program does not require
      the Company to repurchase any specific number of shares, and the Company
      may terminate the repurchase program at any time.  On November
      13, 2009, the board of directors increased the number of shares authorized
      for repurchase to 1,500,000.  On February 10, 2010, the board
      extended the termination date of the program from April 22, 2010 to

CERTIFICATION
OF CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
 
I, Ray
Singleton, hereby certify that:
 




1.

 
      

I
      have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of Basic Earth Science
      Systems, Inc. (the “registrant”);


 
      
 
      
 
      


2.

 
      

Based
      on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a
      material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
      statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
      were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this
      report;


 
      
 
      
 
      


3.

 
      

Based
      on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information
      included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the
      financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the
      registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this
      report;


 
      
 
      
 
      


4.

 
      

The
      registrant’s other certifying officer and I are responsible for
      establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as
      defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal
      control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules
      13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and
  have:



 



 
      

(a)

 
      

Designed
      such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure
      controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure
      that material information relating to the registrant, including its
      consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those
      entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being
      prepared;


 
      
 
      
 
      
 
      

 
      

(b)

 
      

Designed
      such internal controls over financial reporting, or caused such internal
      control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to
      provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
      reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
      purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
      principles;


 
      
 
      
 
      
 
      

 
      

(c)

 
      

Evaluated
      the effectiveness of the registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures
      and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of

2.

 
      

Based
      on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a
      material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the

      prepared;


 
      
 
      
 
      
 
      

 
      

(b)

 
      

Designed
      such internal controls over financial reporting, or caused such internal
      control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to
      provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
      reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
      purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
      principles;

      in this report any change in the registrant’s internal control over
      financial reporting that occurred during the registrant’s most recent

      annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
      materially affect, the registrant’s internal control over financial
      reporting; and



 




5.

 
      

The
      registrant’s other certifying officers and I have disclosed, based on our
      most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to
      the registrant’s auditors and the audit committee of registrant’s board of
