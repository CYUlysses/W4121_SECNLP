FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS

                   This
Current Report on Form 10-Q, including information incorporated herein by
reference, contains forward-looking statements as defined in the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The use of any statements containing
the words "anticipate," "intend," "believe," "estimate," "project," "expect,"
"plan," "should" or similar expressions are intended to identify such
statements. Forward-looking statements relate to, among other
things:

•      our future
financial position, including anticipated liquidity;
•      amounts
and nature of future capital expenditures;
•      acquisitions
and other business opportunities;
•      operating
costs and other expenses;
•      wells
expected to be drilled;
•      asset
retirement obligations; and
•      estimates
of proved oil and natural gas reserves, deferred tax assets, and depletion
rates.
  
                   Factors
that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations
include, among others, such things as:

•      oil and
natural gas prices;
•      our
ability to replace oil and natural gas reserves;
•      loss of
senior management or technical personnel;
•      inaccuracy
in reserve estimates and expected production rates;
•      exploitation,
development and exploration results, including from enhanced
recovery
activities;
•      costs
related to asset retirement obligations;
•      a
lack of available capital and financing;
•      the
potential unavailability of drilling rigs and other field equipment and
services;
•      the
existence of unanticipated liabilities or problems relating to acquired
properties;
•      general
economic, market or business conditions;




 
      


•


factors
      affecting the nature and timing of our capital expenditures, including the
      availability of service contractors and equipment, permitting issues,
      workovers, and weather;








 
      


•


the
      impact and costs related to compliance with or changes in laws or
      regulations governing our oil and natural gas
  operations;








 
      


•


environmental
      liabilities;








 
      


•


acquisitions
      and other business opportunities (or the lack thereof) that may be
      presented to and pursued by us;








 
      


•


competition
      for available properties and the effect of such competition on the price
      of those properties;




•      risk
factors discussed in this report; and
•      other
factors, many of which are beyond our control.

Although we believe that the
expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, those
expectations may prove to be incorrect.  Disclosure of important
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our
expectations, or cautionary statements, are included in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, under the heading "Risk
Factors", and elsewhere in this report, including, without limitation, in
conjunction with the forward-looking statements.  All forward-looking
statements speak only as of the date made.  All subsequent written and
oral forward-looking statements attributable to us, or persons acting on our
behalf, are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary
statements.  Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to
update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after
the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or
unanticipated events or circumstances.

corporation, Basic Earth Science Systems, Inc. and its subsidiaries, and are not
used in reference to the board of directors, corporate officers, management, or
any individual employee or group of employees.

The
financial statements included herein have been prepared by the Company pursuant
to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been
condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. We believe the
disclosures made are adequate to make the information not misleading and suggest
that these financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial
statements and notes hereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-KSB for the

1.
Presentation of Consolidated Financial Statements

As
discussed in our 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-KSB for the fiscal year ended
March 31, 2008, we discovered during the preparation and review of our 2008
income tax provision that errors occurred in calculating the GAAP cost basis of
our oil and gas properties in determining tax liability and the estimated
deferred tax asset for percentage depletion carryforward. These errors impacted
our previously filed financial statements for fiscal years ended March 31, 2007
and 2006 and our previously filed interim financial statements for those years
and the first three quarters of 2008. For further information concerning the
restatement and details concerning restated amounts, please refer to our
previously filed Annual Report on Form 10-KSB for the fiscal year ended March
31, 2008.

The
following table summarizes the impact of these corrections to our
consolidated  statement of income for the fiscal quarter ended
December 31, 2007, as previously presented in Footnote 13 – Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)
of our Annual Report on Form 10-KSB for the fiscal year ended March 31,
2007. There was no impact to our 2008 interim Net Cash provided by Operating
Activities due to the correction of the above errors.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting
Pronouncements

Use of Estimates.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the actual amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the actual amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. We base these estimates on assumptions that we understand are
reasonable under the circumstances. The estimated results that are produced by
this effort will differ under different assumptions or conditions.  We
understand that these estimates are necessary and that actual results could vary
significantly from the estimated amounts for the current and future periods.
There are many factors, including global events, which may influence the
production, processing, marketing, and valuation of crude oil and natural gas. A
reduction in the valuation of oil and gas properties resulting from declining
prices or production could adversely impact depletion rates and ceiling test
limitations. We understand the following accounting policies and estimates are
necessary in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: the
carrying value of our oil and gas property, the accounting for oil and gas
reserves, the estimate of our asset retirement obligations, the estimate of our
income tax assets and liabilities and estimates of accrued quantities and prices
in our oil and gas receivable.

Cash and Cash
Equivalents. For purposes of the Consolidated Balance Sheets and
Statements of Cash Flows, we consider all highly liquid investments with a
maturity of ninety days or less when purchased to be cash
equivalents.

Oil and Gas
Reserves. Oil and gas reserves represent theoretical, estimated
quantities of crude oil and natural gas which geological and engineering data
estimate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known
reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. There are numerous
uncertainties inherent in estimating oil and gas reserves and their values,
including many factors beyond our control. Accordingly, reserve estimates are
different from the quantities of oil and gas ultimately recovered and the
corresponding lifting costs associated with the recovery of these reserves. At
March 31, 2008, ninety-five percent of our reported oil and gas reserves are
based on estimates prepared by Ryder Scott Company, L.P, a nationally
recognized, independent petroleum engineering firm. The remaining five percent
of our oil and gas reserves were prepared in-house.

Each
quarter, we update reserve estimates by substituting the prices we would have
received at quarter-end for the year-end prices that were used by our
independent petroleum engineers.  In conducting this “re-pricing” no
changes are made to the decline rates, tax rates or lifting costs used by our
independent petroleum engineers.  The determination of depletion
expense, as well as ceiling test write-downs, are highly dependent on these
reserve, and quarterly “re-pricing” estimates.

Oil and Gas
Property. We utilize the full cost method of accounting for costs related
to our oil and gas property. Capitalized costs included in the full cost pool
are depleted on an aggregate basis over the estimated lives of the properties
using the units-of-production method. These capitalized costs are subject to a
ceiling test that limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value
of future net revenues attributable to proved oil and gas reserves discounted at
10 percent plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties
less any associated tax effects. If the full cost pool of capitalized oil and
gas property costs exceeds the ceiling, we will record a ceiling test write-down
to the extent of such excess. This write-down is a non-cash charge to earnings.
If required, it reduces earnings and impacts shareholders’ equity in the period
of occurrence. The write-down may not be reversed in future periods, even though
higher oil and gas prices in the future may subsequently and significantly
increase reserve estimates in future periods.

As of
December 31, 2008, we determined that our capitalized costs exceeded the ceiling
test limit.  Accordingly, we recorded an impairment write down of
$2,694,000 representing the excess of capitalized costs over the ceiling, as
calculated in accordance with these full cost rules for both the quarter and
nine months ended December 31, 2008.

Asset Retirement
Obligations. We have obligations related to the plugging and abandonment
of our oil and gas wells, the removal of equipment and facilities, and returning
the land to its original condition. SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations” requires that we estimate the future cost of this
obligation, discount this cost to its present value, and record a corresponding
asset and liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The values ultimately
derived are based on many significant estimates, including the ultimate expected
cost of the obligation, the expected future date of the required cash
expenditures, and inflation rates. The nature of these estimates requires us to
make judgments based on historical experience and future expectations related to
timing. We review the estimate of our future asset retirement obligations
quarterly. These quarterly reviews may require revisions to these estimates
based on such things as changes to cost estimates or the timing of future cash
outlays. Any such changes that result in upward or downward revisions in the
estimated obligation will result in an adjustment to the related capitalized
asset and corresponding liability on a prospective basis.
 
We
recognize two components on our consolidated statement of income; accretion of
asset retirement obligations and asset retirement expense.  Accretion
of asset retirement obligation reflects the periodic accretion of the present
value of future plugging and abandonment costs.  Asset retirement
expense reflects the actual current period gains and losses on plugging and
abandonment costs relative to previously estimated future
costs.  Since our initial adoption of FASB No. 143 we have closed
gains and losses on asset retirements to the income statement as a component of
asset retirement expense.

The
information below reconciles the value of the asset retirement obligation for
the period presented.

Income Taxes.
We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
“Accounting for Income Taxes”. Accordingly, deferred tax liabilities and assets
are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial
statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in
effect for the year in which the differences are expected to
reverse.

Projections
of future income taxes and their timing require significant estimates with
respect to future operating results. Accordingly, the net deferred tax liability
is continually re-evaluated and numerous estimates are revised over time. As
such, the net deferred tax liability may change significantly as more
information and data is gathered with respect to such events as changes in
commodity prices, their effect on the estimate of oil and gas reserves, and the
depletion of these long-lived reserves.
 
On
April 1, 2007 we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109
(FIN 48). The adoption of FIN 48 had no impact on our consolidated financial
statements. We are subject to U.S. federal income tax and income tax from
multiple state jurisdictions. The tax years remaining subject to examination by
tax authorities are fiscal years 2004 through 2006. We recognize interest and
penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. As of
December 31, 2008, we made no provisions for interest or penalties related to
uncertain tax positions.

Earnings Per
Share. Our earnings per share (EPS) is computed by dividing net income by
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted
EPS is calculated by dividing net income by the diluted weighted average number
of common shares. The diluted weighted average number of common shares is
computed using the treasury stock method for common stock that may be issued for
outstanding stock options.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

In
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (Revised 2007), “Business
Combinations” (“SFAS 141R”). SFAS 141R will significantly change the accounting
for business combinations in a number of areas including the treatment of
contingent consideration, contingencies, acquisition costs, research and
development assets and restructuring costs. In addition, under SFAS 141R,
changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax
uncertainties in a business combination after the measurement period will impact
income taxes. SFAS 141R is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2008. The adoption of the provisions of SFAS 141R is not
expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of
operations, or cash flows.

In
February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option
for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities”, providing companies with an
option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The
Standard’s objective is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial
instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets
and liabilities differently. Generally
accepted accounting principles have required different measurement attributes
for different assets and liabilities that can create artificial volatility in
earnings. SFAS 159 helps to mitigate this type of accounting-induced volatility
by enabling companies to report related assets and liabilities at fair value,
which would likely reduce the need for companies to comply with detailed rules
for hedge accounting. SFAS
159 also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to
facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement
attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. The
Standard requires companies to provide additional information that will help
investors and other users of financial statements to more easily understand the
effect of our choice to use fair value on its earnings. It also requires
entities to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the
Company has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet. The
adoption of the provisions of SFAS 159 did not have a material effect on our
financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

In
September 2006,
the FASB issued SFAS Statement No. 157,
“Fair Value Measurements”. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework
for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
2007.  In
February 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position No.
FAS 157-2.  That guidance proposed a one year deferral of the
implementation of SFAS 157 for non-financial assets and liabilities that
are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis (less frequent
than annually).

On April
1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 157 with the one-year deferral for non-financial
assets and liabilities.  The adoption of SFAS No. 157 did not
have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash
flows.  Beginning April 1, 2009, we expect to adopt the provisions for
non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities that are not required or
permitted to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis.  While we
are in the process of evaluating this standard with respect to its effect on
non- financial assets and liabilities, we have not yet determined the impact
that it will have on our financial statements upon full adoption in
2009.

Subsequent Events

On
January 14, 2009, FieldPoint Petroleum Corporation announced that it had
filed a Registration Statement on Form S-4 to register shares of its common
stock proposed to be issued in connection with a potential exchange offer for a
minimum of 51% and a maximum of 100% of the outstanding shares of the Company’s
common stock.  The exchange ratio that FieldPoint has disclosed is one
share of FieldPoint common stock for every two shares of the Company’s common
stock and would be subject to a number of conditions.  FieldPoint did
not have any substantive communications with the Company before issuing its
press release. 

On
February 4, 2009, our Board of Directors (the “Board”) declared a dividend
(the “Dividend”) of one preferred share purchase right (a “Right”) for each
outstanding share of common stock.  The dividend is payable on
February 17, 2009 to holders of record on that date.  On
February 4, 2009, we entered into a Rights Agreement, with Corporate Stock
Transfer, Inc. as the Rights Agent (the “Rights Agreement”), specifying the
terms of the Rights.

The Board
has authorized the adoption of a Rights Agreement to protect stockholders from
coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics. In general terms, the Rights
impose a significant penalty upon any person or group that acquires beneficial
ownership of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock without the prior
approval of the Board.  The Rights Agreement will provide an exemption
for (i) any person who is, as of February 17, 2009, the beneficial owner of
15% or more of our outstanding common stock, so long as such person does not,
subject to certain exceptions, acquire additional common stock of the Company
after February 17, 2009, and (ii) Ray J. Singleton, Jr., the Company’s
President and Chief Executive Officer, and his family and certain affiliates
(collectively, the “Grandfathered Persons”), so long as such Grandfathered
Persons, individually or in the aggregate, do not, subject to certain
exceptions, acquire additional common stock of the Company such that their
aggregate ownership exceeds 36% of the then outstanding common stock of the
Company.  Mr. Singleton currently owns approximately 26% of our
outstanding common stock.  The Company, its subsidiaries, employee
benefit plans of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, and any entity holding
common stock for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan will also be
excepted.

 In
connection with the adoption of the Rights Agreement on February 4, 2009, we
filed a Certificate of Designations of Series A Junior Participating
Preferred Stock (the “Certificate of Designations”) with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware to create the Preferred Shares.

Also on
February 4, 2009, we amended our bylaws to add a provision requiring a
stockholder who seeks to present business or to nominate directors for election
at a stockholders’ meeting to provide notice to us in advance of the meeting and
to include in such notice certain disclosures about the stockholder and the
business to be proposed.

Item 2.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis and Plan of Operation

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

Liquidity
Outlook. Our primary source of funding is the net cash flow from the sale
of our oil and gas production. The profitability and cash flow generated by our
operations in any particular accounting period will be directly related to:
(a) the volume of oil and gas produced and sold, (b) the average realized
prices for oil and gas sold, and (c) lifting costs. Assuming that oil
prices do not decline from current levels, we believe the cash generated from
operations, along with existing cash balances, will enable us to meet our
existing and normal recurring obligations during the next fiscal year and
beyond.

Working Capital.
At December 31, 2008, we had a working capital surplus of $5,761,000 (a
current ratio of 3.52:1) compared to a working capital surplus at March 31, 2008
of $3,168,000 (a current ratio of 1.79:1). The increase is a result of our
improved cash position due to overall increases in price and production of oil
and gas for the nine month period ended December 31, 2008.

Cash Flow.
Net cash provided by operating activities increased 64% from $2,649,000
in the nine months ended December 31, 2007 (“2007”) to $4,344,000 in the nine
months ended December 31, 2008 (“2008”) due to increased oil commodity prices
and production volumes in the latest nine month period.  While not
reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Income, this level of cash flow was
determined by reconciling net income with, among other things, impairment and
depletion expense within the “net cash provided by operating activities”
section.

Net cash
used in investing activities increased 1,080% from $304,000 during 2007 to
$3,587,000 in the nine months ended December 31, 2008. The difference relates
primarily to timing of cash payments relating to expenditures of the drilling
and completion of the new wells in DJ Basin of Colorado.  We also used
a de minimis amount of cash for our stock buyback program. (For further
information refer to Part II, Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity
Securities and Use of Proceeds).

Credit
Line. Our current banking relationship, established in March 2002,
is with American National Bank (“the Bank”), located in Denver, Colorado.
Subject to several amendments over time, the line of credit amount was set at
$20,000,000 with a concurrent borrowing base of $4,000,000. Effective
December 31, 2008 the loan agreement was amended to extend the maturity
date of the credit agreement to December 31, 2010.  We renewed
the line with an interest rate of prime plus 0.25% or 6.5% whichever is
higher.  During the year ended March 31, 2008 and for the nine
months ending December 31, 2008, we did not utilize our credit
facility.  The loan contains several covenant
restrictions.  Since inception this loan facility has contained a
covenant that makes the loan callable upon a change of control.  At
December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with all covenants.  This
line may be used for purposes of borrowing funds to reduce payables, finance
re-completion or drilling efforts, fund property acquisitions, or pursue other
opportunities we cannot envision at this time.
 
Capital
Expenditures

The
amounts presented herein are presented on an accrual basis, and as such may not
be consistent with the amounts presented on the consolidated statement of cash
flows under investing activities for expenditures on oil and gas property in
that the amounts contained therein are presented on a cash basis.

During
the quarter ended December 31, 2008, we spent approximately $353,000 on various
projects.  When combined with first and second quarter investments, we
have deployed $1,568,000 through the first nine months of the current fiscal
year.  This compares to $945,000 and $1,328,000 for the quarter and
nine months ended December 31, 2007, respectively. Through the first nine months
of fiscal 2008, approximately 83% of capital expenditures were dedicated to
drilling and completions, 7% was dedicated to preservation of expiring leases
and 10% was dedicated to the acquisition of producing
properties.

During
the quarter ended December 31, 2008, we estimate that we spent 51% of our
capital expenditure amount on the Crown 41-31 project in Montana, and 23% on
workovers for the Halverson 21-36 in Richland County, Montana.  These
projects were funded with internally generated cash flow from
operations.

Panther
Energy Company, LLC. (Panther), the operator of the Company’s Banks Prospect in
eastern McKenzie County, North Dakota, drilled a second well on that
prospect.  In addition, Panther attempted twice to hydraulically
stimulate the first well on the prospect but had to postpone its operations due
to adverse winter weather conditions.  Panther has informed the
Company that Panther intends to move its rig to Montana to drill two wells for a
third party and then return to the Banks Prospect in late spring.  The
Company will evaluate the drilling results for these two wells before committing
the Company to fund capital expenditures related to additional wells on the
Banks Prospect.  The Company has a 6.5% (32.5% of 20%) carried working
interest “to the tanks” on the Banks acreage contributed to the spacing unit on
each well.  Pursuant to the Farmout Agreement between the Company and
Panther, Panther earned its 67.5% interest in the Banks acreage upon completion
of the second well.  The Company has the right to participate in wells
for a 6.5% working interest on the Banks acreage contributed to any spacing unit
in the future.

Due to
the precipitous drop in oil commodity prices and the relatively high service
company prices, the Company and its 50% partner at the South Flat Lake prospect
in Montana re-evaluated the economics of a vertical Red River test well on the
prospect and decided to postpone drilling.  If commodity prices and
drilling costs improve, the Company and its partner would drill an initial well
at a total cost estimated currently to be approximately
$1.35 million.

At
present cash levels, and with the extension of our available borrowing capacity,
we expect to have sufficient funds available for our share of any additional
acreage, seismic and/or drilling cost requirements that might arise from these
opportunities.  We may alter or vary all or part of these planned
capital expenditures for reasons including but not limited to; changes in
circumstances, unforeseen opportunities, inability to negotiate favorable
acquisition, farmout or joint venture terms, lack of cash flow, and lack of
additional funding.

We
currently have no capital expenditure commitments.  We are continually
evaluating other drilling and acquisition opportunities for possible
participation. Typically, at any one time, several opportunities are in various
stages of due diligence. Our policy is to not disclose the specifics of a
project or prospect, nor to speculate on such ventures, until such time as those
various opportunities are finalized and undertaken. We caution that the absence
of news and/or press releases should not be interpreted as a lack of development
or activity.

Divestitures/Abandonments

During
the quarter ended December 31, 2008 we plugged no additional
wells.  Instead, all expenses incurred during the quarter were for
surface restoration.  
 
Results
of Operations

Overview.
Net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2008 was $1,570,000
compared to net income of $437,000, as restated, for the three months ended
December 31, 2007.  Net income for the nine months ended December 31,
2008 was $756,000 compared to net income of $1,154,000 as restated for the nine
months ended December 31, 2007.

Months Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to Three Months Ended December 31,
2007

Revenues.
Oil and gas sales revenue increased $84,000 (4%) in 2008 from 2007 due to
increased production partially offset by decreased prices. Oil sales revenue
decreased $369,000 (19%), and gas sales revenue increased $453,000 (285%) in
2008 from 2007. 

Volumes and
Prices. Oil sales volumes increased 27%, from 23,200 barrels in 2007 to
29,400 barrels in 2008 while there was a decrease of 36% in the average price
per barrel from $82.62 in 2007 to $52.80 in 2008. The increase in oil sales
volume is attributed primarily to the production of our Antenna Federal property
in Weld County, Colorado.  Gas sales volume increased 177% from
23.5 million cubic feet (MMcf) in 2007 to 65.1 MMcf in 2008, while the
average price per Mcf decreased 58%, from $6.76 in 2007 to $2.86 in 2008. The
increase in gas sales volume is primarily due to bringing back online wells in
the Antenna Federal property in Weld County, Colorado, as well as the production
of new wells in the same property. On an equivalent barrel (BOE) basis,
sales volume increased 48% from 27,200 BOE in 2007 to 40,300 BOE in
2008.

Expenses.
Oil and gas production expense increased $182,000 (32%) in 2008 over 2007. Oil
and gas production expense is comprised of two components: routine lease
operating expenses and workovers. Routine expenses typically include such items
as daily well maintenance, utilities, fuel, water disposal, minor surface
equipment repairs, and marketing and transportation costs. Workovers, on the
other hand, which primarily include downhole repairs, are generally random in
nature. Although workovers are expected, they can be much more frequent in some
wells than others and their cost can be significant. Therefore, workovers
account for more dramatic fluctuations in oil and gas production expense from
period to period.

Routine
lease operating expense increased $116,000 (27%) from $427,000 in 2007 to
$543,000 in 2008, primarily due to higher production volumes, while workover
expense increased $66,000 (49%) from $134,000 in 2007 to $200,000 in 2008.
Routine lease operating expense per BOE decreased 14% from $15.71 in 2007 to
$13.47 in 2008 while workover expense per BOE increased 1% from $4.92 in 2007 to
$4.96 in 2008.

Production
taxes, which are generally a percentage of sales revenue, decreased $60,000
(33%) in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to the decline of oil prices.
Production taxes, as a percent of sales revenue decreased from 9% in 2007 to 5%
in 2008.  The overall lifting cost (oil and gas production expense and
production taxes) per BOE decreased 21% from $27.24 in 2007 to $21.41 in
2008.
 
Depreciation
and depletion expense increased $384,000 (219%) in 2008 compared to 2007 as a
result of a decrease in our reserve values due to the decline in oil and gas
prices.  In addition, we recorded an impairment write down of
$2,694,000 representing the excess of capitalized costs over the ceiling, as
calculated in accordance with full cost rules for both the quarter and nine
months ended December 31, 2008. For further discussion concerning the ceiling
test limitations, see Note 2 under “Oil and Gas
Property.”  

General
and administrative expense increased $179,000 (92%) in 2008 over 2007. These
increases were primarily the result of increased expenditures attributable to
the restatement of our financial statements, along with increases in consulting
fees, and to a lesser extent, increases in the number of office
personnel.  G&A expense per BOE increased 29% from $7.19 in 2007
to $9.28 in 2008. As a percent of total sales revenue, G&A expense increased
from 9% in 2007 to 17% in 2008.

Nine Months Ended December 31, 2008
Compared to Nine Months Ended December 31, 2007

Revenues.
Oil and gas sales revenue increased $2,701,000 (49%) in 2008 from 2007. Oil
sales revenue increased $1,767,000 (36%). Gas sales revenue increased $934,000
(161%) in 2008 from 2007.

Volumes and
Prices. Oil sales volumes increased 6%, from 68,300 barrels in 2007 to
72,700 barrels in 2008 while there was a 28% increase in the average price per
barrel from $71.61 in 2007 to $91.57 in 2008. Gas sales volume increased 67%,
from 88.1 million cubic feet (MMcf) in 2007 to 147 MMcf in 2008, while the
average price per Mcf increased 12%, from $6.60 in 2007 to $7.39 in 2008. The
increase in gas sales volume is primarily due to production brought online from
our 16-well drilling program in Weld County, Colorado. On an equivalent barrel
(BOE) basis, sales volume increased 17% from 83,000 BOE in 2007 to 97,200
BOE in 2008.

Expenses.
Oil and gas production expense increased $354,000 (23%) in 2008 over 2007. Oil
and gas production expense is comprised of two components: routine lease
operating expenses and workovers. Routine expenses typically include such items
as daily well maintenance, utilities, fuel, water disposal and minor surface
equipment repairs. Workovers, on the other hand, which primarily include
downhole repairs, are generally random in nature. Although workovers are
expected, they can be much more frequent in some wells than others and their
cost can be significant. Therefore, workovers account for more dramatic
fluctuations in oil and gas production expense from period to
period.

Routine
lease operating expense increased $270,000 (22%) from $1,211,000 in 2007 to
$1,481,000 in 2008 primarily due to higher production volumes, while workover
expense increased $84,000 (27%) from $307,000 in 2007 to $391,000 in 2008.
Routine lease operating expense per BOE increased 4% from $14.59 in 2007 to
$15.24 in 2008 while workover expense per BOE increased 9% from $3.70 in 2007 to
$4.02 in 2008.

Production
taxes, which are generally a percentage of sales revenue, increased $155,000
(33%) in 2008 over 2007. Production taxes, as a percent of sales revenue
decreased from 8% in 2007 to 7% in 2008. The overall lifting cost (oil and gas
production expense and production taxes) per BOE increased 7% from $23.87 in
2007 to $25.62 in 2008.

Depreciation
and depletion expense increased $445,000 (84%) in 2008 over 2007 as a result of
a decrease in our reserve values due to the decline in oil and gas
prices.  In addition, we recorded an impairment write down of
$2,694,000 representing the excess of capitalized costs over the ceiling, as
calculated in accordance with full cost rules for both the quarter and nine
months ended December 31, 2008.  For further discussion concerning the
ceiling test limitations, see Note 2 under “Oil and Gas
Property.” 

General
and administrative expense increased $414,000 (80%) in 2008 over 2007. These
increases were primarily the result of increased expenditures attributable to
the restatement of our financial statements, implementation of Sarbanes-Oxley
404 requirements, along with increases in consulting fees, and to a lesser
extent, increases in the number of office personnel. G&A expense per BOE
increased 53% from $6.25 in 2007 to $9.59 in 2008. As a percent of total sales
revenue, G&A expense increased from 10% in 2007 to 11% in 2008.

Income Tax
Expense. For the nine months ended December 31, 2008 we recorded income
tax expense of $151,000. This includes a current year expense of $444,000 and a
deferred tax provision of $(293,000).  Our effective income tax rate
decreased from 53.56% for the nine months ended December 31, 2007 to 15.96% for
2008. Our effective income tax rate was lower for 2008 primarily due to an
increase in estimated deductions for statutory depletion relative to pre-tax net
income.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

As a
crude oil and natural gas producer, our revenue, cash flow from operations,
other income and profitability, reserve values, access to capital and future
rate of growth are substantially dependent upon the prevailing prices of crude
oil and natural gas. Declines in commodity prices will materially and adversely
affect our financial condition, liquidity, ability to obtain financing and
operating results. Lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of crude oil and
natural gas that we can produce economically. Prevailing prices for such
commodities are subject to wide fluctuation in response to relatively minor
changes in supply and demand and a variety of additional factors beyond our
control, such as global, political and economic conditions. Historically, prices
received for crude oil and natural gas production have been volatile and
unpredictable, and such volatility is expected to continue. Most of our
production is sold at market prices. Generally, if the commodity indexes fall,
the price that we receive for our production will also decline. Therefore, the
amount of revenue that we realize is to a large extent determined by factors
beyond our control.

Item
4. Controls and Procedures

The
Company maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures that are
designed for the purpose of ensuring that information required to be disclosed
in its SEC reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information
is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the Chief
Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosures.

For the
quarter ended December 31, 2008 we carried out an evaluation, under the
supervision and with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer
and Principal Accounting Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and
operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that
evaluation, it was concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and
procedures are effective for the purposes discussed above.

There
have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
that occurred during the Company’s quarter ended December 31, 2008 that have
materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

      program for the Company to repurchase up to 500,000 shares of its common
      stock. The program does not have a specified expiration date, it does not
      require the Company to repurchase any specific number of shares, and the
      Company may terminate the repurchase program at any
      time.  During the three months ended December 31, 2008, 21,600

Item 5. Other Information

On
January 14, 2009, FieldPoint Petroleum Corporation announced that it had
filed a Registration Statement on Form S-4 to register shares of its common
stock proposed to be issued in connection with a potential exchange offer for a
minimum of 51% and a maximum of 100% of the outstanding shares of the Company’s
common stock.  The exchange ratio that FieldPoint has disclosed is one
share of FieldPoint common stock for every two shares of the Company’s common
stock and would be subject to a number of conditions.  FieldPoint did
not have any substantive communications with the Company before issuing its
press release. 

On
February 5, 2009, the Company filed a Current Report on Form 8-K to report
that the Company’s Board of Directors had adopted a Stockholders Rights Plan and
declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each outstanding
share of common stock, payable to holders of record on February 17,
2009.

On
February 4, 2009, the Board of Directors amended the Company’s Bylaws to add a
provision requiring a stockholder who seeks to present business or to nominate
directors for election at a stockholders’ meeting to provide notice to the
Company in advance of the meeting and to include in such notice certain
disclosures about the stockholder and the business to be proposed.  A
copy of the Company’s Bylaws, as amended, is filed with this report and is
incorporated herein by reference.

To
propose nominations for director at a meeting of stockholders, a stockholder
must timely submit a stockholder’s notice in accordance with Section 6 of the
Company’s bylaws.  To be timely, a stockholder must provide notice to
the Company’s secretary not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to
the date of the meeting.  A stockholder’s notice regarding nominations
of persons for election to the Board of Directors must set forth: (a) as to each
proposed nominee, (i) the name, age, business address and residence address of
the nominee, (ii) the principal occupation or employment of the nominee, (iii)
the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of the corporation
that are owned beneficially or of record by the nominee and (iv) any other
information relating to the nominee that would be required to be disclosed in a
proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with
solicitations of proxies for election of directors pursuant to Section 14 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder; and (b) as to the stockholder giving the
notice, (i) the name and record address of such stockholder, (ii) the class or
series and number of shares of capital stock of the corporation which are owned
beneficially or of record by such stockholder, (iii) all other ownership
interests of such stockholder, including derivatives, hedged positions,
synthetic and temporary ownership techniques, swaps, securities, loans, timed
purchases and other economic and voting interests, (iv) a description of all
arrangements or understandings between such stockholder and each proposed
nominee and any other person or persons (including their names) pursuant to
which the nomination(s) are to be made by such stockholder, (v) a representation
that such stockholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to
nominate the persons named in such stockholder’s notice and (vi) any other
information relating to such stockholder that would be required to be disclosed
in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with
solicitations of proxies for election of directors pursuant to Section 14 of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

Such
stockholder’s notice must be accompanied by a written consent of each proposed
nominee to being named as a nominee and to serve as a director if
elected.  In addition, each proposed nominee will be required to
complete a questionnaire, in a form to be provided by the Company, to be
submitted with the stockholder’s notice. The Company may also require any
proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required
by the Company to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as
an independent director of the Company or that could be material to a reasonable
stockholder’s understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such
nominee.

Determinations
of the chairman of the meeting as to whether those procedures were complied with
in a particular case shall be final and binding.

directors’ interest, or for any other reason.
 
        
(5) In

conferred upon them, the directors are hereby empowered to exercise all such

of
 
SERIES
A JUNIOR PARTICIPATING PREFERRED STOCK
 
of
 
BASIC
EARTH SCIENCE SYSTEMS, INC.
 
(Pursuant
to Section 151 of the
Delaware
General Corporation Law)
 
____________________
 
Basic
Earth Science Systems, Inc., a corporation organized and existing under the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (hereinafter called the
“Corporation”), hereby certifies that the following resolution was adopted by
the Board of Directors of the Corporation as required by Section 151 of the
General Corporation Law at a meeting duly called and held on February 4,
2009:
 
RESOLVED,
that pursuant to the authority granted to and vested in the Board of Directors
of this Corporation (hereinafter called the “Board of Directors” or the “Board”)
in accordance with the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, the Board
of Directors hereby creates a series of Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per
share, of the Corporation (the “Preferred Stock”), and hereby states the
designation and number of shares, and fixes the relative rights, preferences,
and limitations thereof as follows:
 
Series A
Junior Participating Preferred Stock:
 
Section
1.  Designation and
Amount.  The shares of such series shall be designated as
“Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock” (the “Series A
Preferred Stock”) and the number of shares constituting the Series A
Preferred Stock shall be 100,000.  Such number of shares may be
increased or decreased by resolution of the Board of Directors; provided, that no
decrease shall reduce the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to a
number less than the number of shares then outstanding plus the number of shares
reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding options, rights or
warrants or upon the conversion of any outstanding securities issued by the
Corporation convertible into Series A Preferred Stock.
 


 



10





 



 
Section
2.  Dividends and
Distributions.
 
(A)           Subject
to the rights of the holders of any shares of any series of Preferred Stock (or
any similar stock) ranking prior and superior to the Series A Preferred
Stock with respect to dividends, the holders of shares of Series A
Preferred Stock, in preference to the holders of Common Stock, par value $0.001
per share (the “Common Stock”), of the Corporation, and of any other junior
stock, shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of
Directors out of funds legally available for the purpose, quarterly dividends
payable in cash on the first day of March, June, September and December in each
year (each such date being referred to herein as a “Quarterly Dividend Payment
Date”), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first
issuance of a share or fraction of a share of Series A Preferred Stock, in
an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (a)
$1.00 or (b) subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth,
1,000 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and 1,000
times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends
or other distributions, other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock
or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification
or otherwise), declared on the Common Stock since the immediately preceding
Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend
Payment Date, since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of
Series A Preferred Stock.  In the event the Corporation shall at
any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of
Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by
payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number
of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the amount to which holders of
shares of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such
event under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by
multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the
denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to such event.
 
(B)           The
Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on the Series A
Preferred Stock as provided in paragraph (A) of this
Section immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the
Common Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock); provided
that, in the event no dividend or distribution shall have been declared on the
Common Stock during the period between any Quarterly Dividend Payment Date and
the next subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, a dividend of $1.00 per
share on the Series A Preferred Stock shall nevertheless be payable on such
subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.
 
(C)           Dividends
shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of Series A
Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date
of issue of such shares, unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to the
record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case
dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such
shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a
date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares of
Series A Preferred Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and
before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such
dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend
Payment Date.  Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear
interest.  Dividends paid on the shares of Series A Preferred
Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time
accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a
share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time
outstanding.  The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the
determination of holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock entitled to
receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record
date shall be not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for the payment
thereof.


 



11





 



 
Section
3.  Voting
Rights.  The holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock
shall have the following voting rights:
 
(A)           Subject
to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each share of
Series A Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to 1,000 votes on
all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the
Corporation.  In the event the Corporation shall at any time declare
or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or
effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares
of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend
in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common
Stock, then in each such case the number of votes per share to which holders of
shares of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such
event shall be adjusted by multiplying such number by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after
such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock
that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
 
(B)           Except
as otherwise provided herein, in any other Certificate of Designations creating
a series of Preferred Stock or any similar stock, or by law, the holders of
shares of Series A Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of Common
Stock and any other capital stock of the Corporation having general voting
rights shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of
stockholders of the Corporation.
 
(C)           Except
as set forth herein, or as otherwise provided by law, holders of Series A
Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their consent shall not
be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders of
Common Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate action.
 
Section
4.  Certain
Restrictions.
 
(A)           Whenever
quarterly dividends or other dividends or distributions payable on the
Series A Preferred Stock as provided in Section 2 are in arrears,
thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions, whether
or not declared, on shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding shall
have been paid in full, the Corporation shall not:
 
(i)           declare
or pay dividends, or make any other distributions, on any shares of stock
ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or
winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock;
 
(ii)           declare
or pay dividends, or make any other distributions, on any shares of stock
ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or
winding up) with the Series A Preferred Stock, except dividends paid
ratably on the Series A Preferred Stock and all such parity stock on which
dividends are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which
the holders of all such shares are then entitled;
 
(iii)           redeem
or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of any stock ranking
junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up)
to the Series A Preferred Stock, provided that the Corporation may at any
time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any such junior stock in
exchange for shares of any stock of the Corporation ranking junior (either as to
dividends or upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up) to the Series A
Preferred Stock; or
 


 



12





 



 
(iv)           redeem
or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of Series A
Preferred Stock, or any shares of stock ranking on a parity with the
Series A Preferred Stock, except in accordance with a purchase offer made
in writing or by publication (as determined by the Board of Directors) to all
holders of such shares upon such terms as the Board of Directors, after
consideration of the respective annual dividend rates and other relative rights
and preferences of the respective series and classes, shall determine in good
faith will result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective series or
classes.
 
(B)           The
Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the Corporation to purchase or
otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the Corporation
unless the Corporation could, under paragraph (A) of this Section 4,
purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such
manner.
 
Section
5.  Reacquired
Shares.  Any shares of Series A Preferred Stock purchased
or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner whatsoever shall be
retired and cancelled promptly after the acquisition thereof.  All
such shares shall upon their cancellation become authorized but unissued shares
of Preferred Stock and may be reissued as part of a new series of Preferred
Stock subject to the conditions and restrictions on issuance set forth herein,
in the Certificate of Incorporation, or in any other Certificate of Designations
creating a series of Preferred Stock or any similar stock or as otherwise
required by law.
 
Section
6.  Liquidation, Dissolution or
Winding Up.  Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of
the Corporation, no distribution shall be made (1) to the holders of shares of
stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or
winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the
holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have received $1.00 per
share, plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions
thereon, whether or not declared, to the date of such payment, provided that the
holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive
an aggregate amount per share, subject to the provision for adjustment
hereinafter set forth, equal to 1,000 times the aggregate amount to be
distributed per share to holders of shares of Common Stock, or (2) to the
holders of shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon
liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series A Preferred Stock,
except distributions made ratably on the Series A Preferred Stock and all
such parity stock in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all
such shares are entitled upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding
up.  In the event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any
dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a
subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common
Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares
of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then
in each such case the aggregate amount to which holders of shares of
Series A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event
under the proviso in clause (1) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted
by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the
denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to such event.
 
Section
7.  Consolidation, Merger,
Etc.  In case the Corporation shall enter into any
consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which the shares of
Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash
and/or any other property, then in any such case each share of Series A
Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or changed into an
amount per share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth,
equal to 1,000 times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any
other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for which
each share of Common Stock is changed or exchanged.  In the event the
Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock
payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or
consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or
otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a
greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the
amount set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to the exchange or
change of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by
multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the
denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to such event.
 


 



13





 



 
Section
8.  No
Redemption.  The shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall
not be redeemable.
 
Section
9.  Rank.  The
Series A Preferred Stock shall rank, with respect to the payment of
dividends and the distribution of assets, junior to all series of any other
class of the Corporation’s Preferred Stock.
 
Section
10.  Amendment.  The
Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation shall not be amended in any
manner which would materially alter or change the powers, preferences or special
rights of the Series A Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely
without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the
outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, voting together as a single
class.

increased or decreased by amendment of these By-Laws by the affirmative vote of

SECTION 14.    INDEMNIFICATION
OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS.
 
(a) The
corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to
be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than
an action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that he
is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or
was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee
or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and
amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection
with such action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner
he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no
reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful.  The termination
of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or
upon a plea of “nolo contendere” or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create
a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had
reasonable cause to believe that this conduct was unlawful.
 
(b) The
corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to
be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in
the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the
fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the
corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys’ fees)
actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or
settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
corporation and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any
claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be
liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of his duty to the
corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the
court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application
that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances
of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such
expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem
proper.
 
(c) To the
extent that a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation has been
successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or
proceeding referred to in subsections (a) and (b), or in defense of any
claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses
(including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in
connection therewith.
 
(d) Any
indemnification under subsections (a) and (b) (unless ordered by a court)
shall be made by the corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a
determination that indemnification of the director, officer, employee or agent
is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of
conduct set forth in subsections (a) and (b).  Such determination
shall be made (1) by the board of directors by a majority vote of a quorum
consisting of directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding,
or (2) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable a quorum
of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written
opinion, or (3) by the stockholders.
 
(e) Expenses
incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding may be paid
by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or
proceeding as authorized by the board of directors in the specific case upon
receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director, officer, employee or
agent to repay such amount unless it shall ultimately be determined that he is
entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized in this
section.
 
(f) The
indemnification provided by this section shall not be deemed exclusive of any
other rights to which those seeking indemnification may be entitled under any
by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise,
both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity
while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to
be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the
heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
 






7









 
(g) The
corporation may, upon approval of the board of directors, purchase and maintain
insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or
agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation
as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against
him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as
such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify him
against such liability under the provisions of this section.
 
(h) For the
purposes of this section, references to “the corporation” include all
constituent corporations absorbed in a consolidation or merger as well as the
resulting or surviving corporation so that any person who is or was a director,
officer, employee or agent of such a constituent corporation or is or was
serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this
section with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he would if he
had served the resulting or surviving corporation in the same
capacity.  (Amended by Resolution 1-81-71 Board
meeting)

request inclusion of proposals in the Company’s proxy statement pursuant to, and
in compliance with the requirements of, Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act of
1934.
 
(a)              
To be timely, a stockholder’s notice to the Secretary must be delivered to or
mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the corporation not
less than ninety (90) days nor more than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to
the date of the meeting; provided, however, that in the event that public
disclosure of the date of the meeting is first made less than one hundred (100)
days prior to the date of the meeting, notice by the stockholder in order to be
timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the tenth
(10th) day
following the day on which such public disclosure of the date of the meeting was
made.

residence address of the nominee, (ii) the principal occupation or employment of
the nominee, (iii) the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of
the corporation that are owned beneficially or of record by the nominee and (iv)
any other information relating to the nominee that would be required to be

connection with solicitations of proxies for election of directors pursuant to
Section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange
Act”), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder; and (b) as to the
stockholder giving the notice, (i) the name and record address of such
stockholder, (ii) the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of
the corporation which are owned beneficially or of record by such stockholder,

any other information relating to such stockholder that would be required to be
disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in
connection with solicitations of proxies for election of directors pursuant to
Section 14 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder.  Such notice must be accompanied by a written consent of
each proposed nominee to being named as a nominee and to serve as a director if
elected.  Each proposed nominee will be required to complete a
questionnaire, in a form to be provided by the Corporation, to be submitted with
the stockholder’s notice. The Corporation may also require any proposed nominee
to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the
Corporation to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as an
independent director of the Corporation or that could be material to a
reasonable stockholder’s understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of
such nominee.
 
(d)              
No business shall be conducted at any meeting of stockholders, and no person
nominated by a stockholder shall be eligible for election as a director, unless
proper notice was given with respect to the proposed action in compliance with
the procedures set forth in this Section 6.  Determinations of the
chairman of the meeting as to whether those procedures were complied with in a
particular case shall be final and binding.
