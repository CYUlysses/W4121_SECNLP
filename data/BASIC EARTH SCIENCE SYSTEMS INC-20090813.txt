FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS

                   This
Current Report on Form 10-Q, including information incorporated herein by
reference, contains forward-looking statements as defined in the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The use of any statements containing
the words "anticipate," "intend," "believe," "estimate," "project," "expect,"
"plan," "should" or similar expressions are intended to identify such
statements. Forward-looking statements relate to, among other
things:

•      our
future financial position, including anticipated liquidity;
•      amounts
and nature of future capital expenditures;
•      acquisitions
and other business opportunities;
•      operating
costs and other expenses;
•      wells
expected to be drilled;
•      asset
retirement obligations; and
•      estimates
of proved oil and natural gas reserves, deferred tax liabilities, and depletion
rates.
  
                   Factors
that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations
include, among others, such things as:

•      oil
and natural gas prices;
•      our
ability to replace oil and natural gas reserves;
•      loss
of senior management or technical personnel;
•      inaccuracy
in reserve estimates and expected production rates;
•      exploitation,
development and exploration results;

•      the
actual costs related to asset retirement obligations, and whether or not those
retirements actually occur in the future;



•      a
lack of available capital and financing;
•      the
potential unavailability of drilling rigs and other field equipment and
services;
•      the
existence of unanticipated liabilities or problems relating to acquired
properties;
•      general
economic, market or business conditions;

•      factors
affecting the nature and timing of our capital expenditures, including the
availability of service contractors and equipment, 
    permitting
issues, workovers, and weather;

•      the
impact and costs related to compliance with or changes in laws or regulations
governing our oil and natural gas operations;


•      environmental
liabilities;

•      acquisitions
and other business opportunities (or the lack thereof) that may be presented to
and pursued by us;



•      competition
for available properties and the effect of such competition on the price of
those properties;
•      risk
factors discussed in this report; and
•      other
factors, many of which are beyond our control.

Although
we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements
are reasonable, those expectations may prove to be
incorrect.  Disclosure of important factors that could cause actual
results to differ materially from our expectations, or cautionary statements,
are included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March
31, 2009, under the heading "Risk Factors", and elsewhere in this report,
including, without limitation, in conjunction with the forward-looking
statements.  All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date
made.  All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements
attributable to us, or persons acting on our behalf, are expressly qualified in
their entirety by the cautionary statements.  Except as required by
law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to
reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect
the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or
circumstances.

Basic Earth Science Systems, Inc.
Notes
to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements
June
30, 2009


1.
Presentation of Consolidated Financial Statements

The
accompanying interim financial statements of Basic Earth Science Systems, Inc.
(sometimes referred to as “the Company” “we” “our” or “us”) are unaudited.
However, in the opinion of management, the interim data includes any applicable
adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim
period.

At the
directive of the Securities and Exchange Commission to use “plain English” in
public filings, the Company will use such terms as “we”, “our” and “us” in place
of Basic Earth Science Systems, Inc. or “the Company.” When such terms are used
in this manner throughout this document they are in reference only to the
corporation, Basic Earth Science Systems, Inc. and its subsidiaries, and are not
used in reference to the board of directors, corporate officers, management, or
any individual employee or group of employees.

The
financial statements included herein have been prepared by the Company pursuant
to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been
condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. We believe the
disclosures made are adequate to make the information not misleading and suggest
that these financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial
statements and related notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended March 31, 2009.

We have
evaluated events subsequent to June 30, 2009 through August 12, 2009, the
filing date of this report, and determined that there were no subsequent events
to recognize or disclose in these consolidated financial statements which would
either impact the results reflected in this report or the Company’s results
going forward.

Organization and
Nature of Operations. Basic Earth Science Systems, Inc. was originally
organized in July 1969 and had its first public offering in 1980. We are
principally engaged in the acquisition, exploitation, development, operation and
production of crude oil and natural gas. Our primary areas of operation are the
Williston basin in North Dakota and Montana, south Texas and the
Denver-Julesburg basin in Colorado.

Principles of
Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include our accounts
and those of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting
Pronouncements

Use of Estimates.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the actual amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the actual amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. We base these estimates on assumptions that we understand are
reasonable under the circumstances. The estimated results that are produced by
this effort will differ under different assumptions or conditions.  We
understand that these estimates are necessary and that actual results could vary
significantly from the estimated amounts for the current and future periods.
There are many factors, including global events, which may influence the
production, processing, marketing, and valuation of crude oil and natural gas. A
reduction in the valuation of oil and gas properties resulting from declining
prices or production could adversely impact depletion rates and ceiling test
limitations. We understand the following accounting policies and estimates are
necessary in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: the
carrying value of our oil and gas property, the accounting for oil and gas
reserves, the estimate of our asset retirement obligations, the estimate of our
income tax assets and liabilities and estimates of accrued quantities and prices
in our oil and gas receivable.

Reserves. Oil and gas reserves represent theoretical, estimated
quantities of crude oil and natural gas which geological and engineering data
estimate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known
reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. There are numerous
uncertainties inherent in estimating oil and gas reserves and their values,
including many factors beyond our control. Accordingly, reserve estimates are
different from the future quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately
recovered and the corresponding lifting costs associated with the recovery of
these reserves. At March 31, 2009, ninety-eight percent of our reported oil and
gas reserves are based on estimates prepared by Ryder Scott Company, L.P, a
nationally recognized, independent petroleum engineering firm. The remaining two
percent of our oil and gas reserves were prepared by our technical in-house
staff.

Each
quarter, we update reserve estimates by substituting the prices we would have
received at quarter-end for the year-end prices that were used by our
independent petroleum engineers.  In conducting this “re-pricing” no
changes are made to the decline rates, tax rates or lifting costs used by our
independent petroleum engineers.  The determinations of depletion
expense, as well as the results of ceiling tests and corresponding write-downs,
if any, are highly dependent on these reserve and quarterly “re-pricing”
estimates.

Oil and Gas
Sales. We derive revenue primarily from the sale of produced natural gas
and crude oil. We report revenue on a gross basis for the amounts received
before taking into account production taxes and transportation costs, which are
reported as separate expenses. Revenue is recorded using the sales method, which
occurs in the month production is delivered to the purchaser, at which time
title changes hands. Payment is generally received between 30 and 90 days
after the date of production. We make estimates of the amount of production
delivered to purchasers and the prices we will receive. We use our knowledge of
our properties, their historical performance, NYMEX and local spot market
prices, and other factors as the basis for these estimates. Variances between
estimates and the actual amounts received are recorded when payment is received,
or when better information is available.

Oil and Gas
Property. We follow the full cost method of accounting for our oil and
gas property. Accordingly, all costs associated with the acquisition,
exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized. These
capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test that limits such pooled costs to
the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved
oil and gas reserves using current prices and costs discounted at
10 percent plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties less
any associated tax effects. If the full cost pool of capitalized oil and gas
property costs exceeds the ceiling, we will record a ceiling test write-down to
the extent of such excess. This write-down is a non-cash charge to earnings. If
required, it reduces earnings and impacts shareholders’ equity in the period of
occurrence. The write-down may not be reversed in future periods, even though
higher oil and gas prices in the future may subsequently and significantly
increase reserve estimates in future periods.  As of June 30, 2009,
our capitalized costs did not exceed the ceiling test limit.

Cash and Cash
Equivalents. For purposes of the Consolidated Balance Sheets and
Statements of Cash Flows, we consider all highly liquid investments with a
maturity of ninety days or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The
carrying amount of cash equivalents approximates fair value because of the
short-term maturity of those instruments. During the period and at the balance
sheet date, balances of cash and cash equivalents exceeded the federally insured
limit.

Support Equipment
and Other. Support equipment (including such items as vehicles, office
furniture and equipment and well servicing equipment) is stated at cost.
Depreciation of support equipment and other property is computed using the
straight-line method over periods ranging from five to seven years.

Inventory.
Inventory, consisting primarily of tubular goods and oil field equipment, is
stated at the lower of cost or market, cost being determined by the FIFO
method.

Long-Term
Assets. We apply Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”
in evaluating all long-lived assets except the full cost pool for possible
impairment. Under SFAS No. 144, long-lived assets are reported at the lower
of cost or their estimated recoverable amounts. During 2009 and 2008, there was
no impairment recorded for long-lived assets.

Fair Value
Measurements. Effective April 1, 2009, we adopted the provisions for
nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not required or
permitted to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis, which include,
among others, those nonfinancial long-lived assets measured at fair value for
impairment assessment and asset retirement obligations initially measured at
fair value. Fair value used in the initial recognition of asset retirement
obligations is determined based on the present value of expected future
dismantlement costs incorporating our estimate of inputs used by industry
participants when valuing similar liabilities. Accordingly, the fair value is
based on unobservable pricing inputs and therefore, is considered a level 3
value input in the fair value hierarchy.

Asset Retirement
Obligations. We have obligations related to the plugging and abandonment
of our oil and gas wells. SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations” requires that we estimate the future cost of this obligation,
discount this cost to its present value, and record a corresponding asset and
liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The values ultimately derived are
based on numerous and significant estimates, including the ultimate expected
cost of the obligation, the expected future date of the required cash
expenditures, and inflation rates. The nature of these estimates requires us to
make judgments based on historical experience and future expectations related to
timing. We review the estimate of our future asset retirement obligations
quarterly. These quarterly reviews may require revisions to these estimates
based on such things as changes to cost estimates or the timing of future cash
outlays. Any such changes that result in upward or downward revisions in the
estimated obligation will result in an adjustment to the related capitalized
asset and corresponding liability on a prospective basis.
 
We
recognize two components on our consolidated statement of operations; accretion
of asset retirement obligations and asset retirement
expense.  Accretion of asset retirement obligation reflects the
periodic accretion of the present value of future plugging and abandonment
costs.  Asset retirement expense reflects the actual current period
gains and losses on plugging and abandonment costs relative to previously
estimated future costs.  Since our initial adoption of FASB No. 143 we
have closed gains and losses on asset retirements to the consolidated statement
of operations as a component of asset retirement expense.

The
information below reconciles the value of the asset retirement obligation for
the period presented.  This includes a short term obligation of
$182,000, which is carried within the accrued liabilities line item of the
balance sheet.

Commitments.  We
currently office in a 4,000 square foot office space located in downtown Denver,
Colorado, and are committed to a total of $281,000 for the five-year lease term
ending April 1, 2013.  We have no off balance sheet transactions
or arrangements.

Income Taxes.
We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
“Accounting for Income Taxes.”  Accordingly, deferred tax liabilities
and assets are determined based on the temporary differences between the
financial statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax
rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to
reverse.

Projections
of future income taxes and their timing require significant estimates with
respect to future operating results. Accordingly, the net deferred tax liability
is continually re-evaluated and numerous estimates are revised over time. As
such, the net deferred tax liability may change significantly as more
information and data is gathered with respect to such events as changes in
commodity prices, their effect on the estimate of oil and gas reserves, and the
depletion of these long-lived reserves.
 
On
April 1, 2007 we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109
(FIN 48). The adoption of FIN 48 had no impact on our consolidated financial
statements. We are subject to U.S. federal income tax and income tax from
multiple state jurisdictions. The tax years remaining subject to examination by
tax authorities are fiscal years 2006 through 2008. We recognize interest and
penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. As of June
30, 2009, we made no provisions for interest or penalties related to uncertain
tax positions.

Earnings Per
Share. Our earnings per share (EPS) is computed by dividing net income by
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted
EPS is calculated by dividing net income by the diluted weighted average number
of common shares. The diluted weighted average number of common shares is
computed using the treasury stock method for common stock that may be issued for
outstanding stock options.  As of the balance sheet date, no dilutive
securities were outstanding.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

In June
2009, The FASB issued SFAS 168, “Accounting Standards Codification and the
Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles—a replacement of FASB
Statement No. 162” (Codification) which will become the source of authoritative
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) recognized by the FASB to
be applied by nongovernmental entities. Rules and interpretive releases of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under authority of federal securities
laws are also sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. On the
effective date of this Statement, the Codification will supersede all
then-existing non-SEC accounting and reporting standards. All other
nongrandfathered non-SEC accounting literature not included in the Codification
will become nonauthoritative.   This Statement is effective for financial
statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after September 15,
2009.  This statement supersedes SFAS 162 “The Hierarchy of Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles.” The adoption of SFAS 168 will not have a
material impact on our consolidated financial statements or results of
operations.

In
June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 165, “Subsequent Events” which
incorporates the subsequent events guidance contained in the auditing standards
literature into authoritative accounting literature. It also requires entities
to disclose the date through which they have evaluated subsequent events and
whether the date corresponds with the release of their financial statements.
SFAS No.165 is effective for all interim and annual periods ending after
June 15, 2009. The Company adopted SFAS No.165 upon its issuance and it had
no material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

On
April 29, 2009, the FASB issued FSP SFAS 107-1 and APB 28-1, “Interim
Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments.” This FSP which amends
SFAS No. 107, “Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments,” to
require publicly-traded companies, as defined in APB Opinion No. 28,
“Interim Financial Reporting,” to provide disclosures on the fair value of
financial instruments in interim financial statements. FSP SFAS 107-1 and APB
28-1 are effective for interim periods ending after June 15, 2009. We have
adopted the provisions of FSP SFAS 107-1, which did not have a material impact
on the Company’s consolidated financial statements or results of
operations.

On
April 9, 2009, the FASB issued FSP SFAS 157-4, “Determining Fair Value When
the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly
Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly,” which provides
additional guidance for estimating fair value in accordance with SFAS
No. 157 when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability
have significantly decreased. This FSP re-emphasizes that regardless of market
conditions the fair value measurement is an exit price concept as defined in
SFAS No. 157. This FSP clarifies and includes additional factors to
consider in determining whether there has been a significant decrease in market
activity for an asset or liability and provides additional clarification on
estimating fair value when the market activity for an asset or liability has
declined significantly. FSP SFAS 157-4 is applied prospectively to all fair
value measurements where appropriate and will be effective for interim and
annual periods ending after June 15, 2009. We have adopted the provisions
of FSP 157-4, which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
statements or results of operations.

On
April 1, 2009, the FASB issued FSP 141(R)-1, “Accounting for Assets
Acquired and Liabilities Assumed in a Business Combination that Arise from
Contingencies” (FSP 141R-1). FSP 141R-1 amends and clarifies SFAS No. 141R
to address application issues associated with initial recognition and
measurement, subsequent measurement and accounting, and disclosure of assets and
liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination. FSP 141R-1 is
effective for assets or liabilities arising from contingencies in business
combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the
first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We
will apply the provisions of FSP 141R-1 to future acquisitions.

In
December 2008, the SEC announced final approval of new requirements for
reporting oil and gas reserves. Among the changes to the disclosure requirements
is a broader definition of reserves, which allows reporting of probable and
possible reserves, in addition to consideration of new technologies and
non-traditional resources. In addition, oil and gas reserves will be reported
using an average price based on the prior 12-month period, rather than year-end
prices, and allow companies to disclose their probable and possible reserves to
investors. The new rules are expected to be effective for years ending on or
after December 31, 2009. The Company is in the process of evaluating the
effect of these new requirements, and has not yet determined the impact that it
will have on its financial statements upon full adoption on March 31,
2010.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (Revised 2007), “Business
Combinations” (“SFAS 141R”). SFAS 141R will significantly change the accounting
for business combinations in a number of areas including the treatment of
contingent consideration, contingencies, acquisition costs, research and
development assets and restructuring costs. In addition, under SFAS 141R,
changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax
uncertainties in a business combination after the measurement period will impact
income taxes. SFAS 141R is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2008. We will apply the provisions of SFAS 141R to future
acquisitions.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “Non-controlling
Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an Amendment of ARB
No. 51.” SFAS 160 amends ARB 51 to establish accounting and reporting
standards for the non-controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the
deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It also amends certain of ARB 51’s
consolidation procedures for consistency with the requirements of SFAS 141R.
SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal
years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The statement shall be
applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the
statement is initially adopted. We have adopted the provisions of SFAS 160 which
did not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations,
or cash flows.

In
February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option
for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities”, providing companies with an
option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The
Standard’s objective is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial
instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets
and liabilities differently. Generally accepted accounting principles have
required different measurement attributes for different assets and liabilities
that can create artificial volatility in earnings. SFAS 159 helps to mitigate
this type of accounting-induced volatility by enabling companies to report
related assets and liabilities at fair value, which would likely reduce the need
for companies to comply with detailed rules for hedge accounting. The Standard
requires companies to provide additional information that will help investors
and other users of financial statements to more easily understand the effect of
our choice to use fair value on its earnings. It also requires entities to
display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the Company has
chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet. The effective date of
SFAS 159 for our Company is April 1, 2008. We have adopted the provisions
of SFAS 159, and it did not have a material effect on our financial condition or
results of operations as we did not make any such elections under this fair
value option.

In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS Statement No. 157, “Fair Value
Measurements.” SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for
measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. In February 2008, the
FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 157-2. That guidance proposed a one year
deferral of the implementation of SFAS 157 for non-financial assets and
liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring
basis (less frequent than annually). On April 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS
No. 157 with the one-year deferral for non-financial assets and
liabilities. The adoption of SFAS No. 157 did not have a material impact on
our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Beginning
April 1, 2009, we have adopted the provisions for non-financial assets and
non-financial liabilities that are not required or permitted to be measured at
fair value on a recurring basis. The adoption did not have a material impact on
our financial statements.

Item
2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

Liquidity
Outlook. Our primary source of funding is the net cash flow from the sale
of our oil and gas production. The profitability and cash flow generated by our
operations in any particular accounting period will be directly related to:
(a) the volume of oil and gas produced and sold, (b) the average realized
prices for oil and gas sold, and (c) lifting costs. Assuming that oil
prices do not decline from current levels, we believe the cash generated from
operations, along with existing cash balances, will enable us to meet our
existing and normal recurring obligations during the next fiscal year and
beyond.

Working Capital.
At June 30, 2009, we had a working capital surplus of $5,075,000 (a
current ratio of 3.82:1) compared to a working capital surplus at March 31, 2009
of $5,045,000 (a current ratio of 4.62:1). The decrease in current ratio is
largely a result of the respective timing of payments made on the accounts
payable balance near the end of March 31, 2009.

Cash Flow.
Net cash provided by operating activities decreased 46.0% from $853,000
in the three months ended June 30, 2008 (“2008”) to $461,000 in the three months
ended June 30, 2009 (“2009”) primarily due to decreased oil and gas commodity
prices.  

Net cash
used in investing activities decreased 81.8% from $1,831,000 during 2008 to
$333,000 in the three months ended June 30, 2009. The difference relates
primarily to significantly more expenditures made during the prior year on the
DJ Basin wells in Colorado.

Net cash
used in financing activities was $162,000 at June 30, 2009 as compared to no
cash used for financing activities at June 30, 2008 since the Company did not
adopt its stock buyback program until October 2008.

Credit
Line. Our current banking relationship, established in March 2002,
is with American National Bank (“the Bank”), located in Denver, Colorado.
Subject to evaluation every six months, the line of credit amount was set at
$20,000,000 with a concurrent borrowing base of $4,000,000. Effective
December 31, 2008 the loan agreement was amended to extend the maturity
date of the credit agreement to December 31, 2010.  We renewed
the line with an interest rate of prime plus 0.25% or 6.5% whichever is
higher.  During the year ended March 31, 2009 and for the three
months ending June 30, 2009, we did not utilize our credit
facility.  The loan contains several covenant
restrictions.   At June 30, 2009, we were in compliance with all
covenants.  This line may be used for purposes of borrowing funds to
reduce payables, finance re-completion or drilling efforts, fund property
acquisitions, or pursue other opportunities that might arise.
 
Capital
Expenditures

The
amounts presented herein are presented on an accrual basis, and as such may not
be consistent with the amounts presented on the consolidated statement of cash
flows under investing activities for expenditures on oil and gas property in
that the amounts contained therein are presented on a cash basis.

During
the quarter ended June 30, 2009, we spent approximately $377,000 on various
projects.   This compares to $640,000 for the quarter ended June
30, 2008.

During
the quarter ended June 30, 2009, nearly 100% of capital expenditures were
dedicated to drilling and completions.  We spent approximately 38% of
our capital expenditures amount on the Crown 41-31 project in McKenzie County,
North Dakota, 12% on the Halvorsen 21X-36 in Richland County, Montana, and 50%
on the Halvorsen State 31X-36 in Richland County, Montana.  These
projects were funded with internally generated cash flow from
operations.

Table of Contents


 
At
present cash levels, and with the extension of our available borrowing capacity,
we expect to have sufficient funds available for our share of any additional
acreage, seismic and/or drilling cost requirements that might arise from these
opportunities.  We may alter or vary all or part of these planned
capital expenditures for reasons including but not limited to; changes in
circumstances, unforeseen opportunities, inability to negotiate favorable
acquisition, farmout or joint venture terms, lack of cash flow, and lack of
additional funding.

We
currently have no capital expenditure commitments.  We are continually
evaluating other drilling and acquisition opportunities for possible
participation. Typically, at any one time, several opportunities are in various
stages of due diligence. Our policy is to not disclose the specifics of a
project or prospect, nor to speculate on such ventures, until such time as those
various opportunities are finalized and undertaken. We caution that the absence
of news and/or press releases should not be interpreted as a lack of development
or activity.

Divestitures/Abandonments

During
the quarter ended June 30, 2009 we plugged no additional
wells.  Instead, all expenses incurred during the quarter were for
surface restoration.  
 
Results
of Operations

Overview.
Net income for the three months ended June 30, 2009 was $249,000
compared to net income of $1,380,000, for the three months ended June 30,
2008.  The following table shows selected financial information for
the quarter ended June 30 in the current and prior year. Certain prior year
amounts may have been reclassified to conform to current year
presentation.

Three
Months Ended June 30, 2009 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30,
2008

Revenues.
Oil and gas sales revenue decreased $1,846,000 (55.8%) in 2009 from 2008 due to
lower realized oil and gas prices. Oil sales revenue decreased $1,602,000
(55.8%), and gas sales revenue decreased $244,000 (56.2%) in 2009 from
2008. 

Volumes and
Prices. Oil sales volumes increased 1.8%, from 23,911 barrels in 2008 to
24,343 barrels in 2009 while there was a decrease of 56.6% in the average price
per barrel from $120.11 in 2008 to $52.17 in 2009. Gas sales volume
decreased 18.3% from 43,072 thousand cubic feet (Mcf) in 2008 to 35,186 Mcf in
2009, while the average price per Mcf decreased 46.4%, from $10.08 in 2008 to
$5.40 in 2009. The decrease in gas sales volume is primarily due to the normal
decline in production in the Antenna Federal property in Weld County, Colorado.
On an equivalent barrel (BOE) basis, sales volume decreased 2.8% from
31,090 BOE in 2008 to 30,207 BOE in 2009.

Expenses.
Oil and gas production expense decreased $98,000 (17.3%) in 2009 over 2008,
primarily due to routine lease operating expense declining by $114,000 (25.2%)
from $453,000 in 2008 to $339,000 in 2009 as a result of decreasing vendor
prices and shutting in high cost wells.  Workover expense, which is
more volatile than routine lease operating expense, increased $16,000 (14.2%)
from $113,000 in 2008 to $129,000 in 2009. Routine lease operating expense per
BOE decreased 23.0% from $14.61 in 2008 to $11.22 in 2009 while workover expense
per BOE increased 17.5% from $3.63 in 2008 to $4.27 in 2009.

Production
taxes, which are generally a percentage of sales revenue, decreased $162,000
(57.4%) in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to the decline of oil prices.
Production taxes, as a percent of sales revenue decreased from 8.5% in 2008 to
8.1% in 2009.  The overall lifting cost (oil and gas production
expense and production taxes) per BOE decreased 28.6% from $27.28 in 2008 to
$19.47 in 2009.
 
Depreciation,
depletion and amortization expense increased $17,000 (7.7%) in 2009 compared to
2008 as a result of a decrease in our reserve values due to the decline in oil
and gas prices.    

General
and administrative expense increased $32,000 (10.6%) in 2009 over 2008. These
increases were primarily the result of increased expenditures attributable to
the graduated increase in office rent and audit fees.  G&A expense
per BOE increased 13.8% from $9.75 in 2008 to $11.09 in 2009. As a percent of
total sales revenue, G&A expense increased from 9.2% in 2008 to 22.7% in
2009.

Income Tax
Expense. For the three months ended June 30, 2009, we recorded an income
tax benefit of $(10,000) as compared to income tax expense of $596,000 for the
three months ended June 30, 2008.  Our effective income tax rate
decreased from 29.97% for the three months ended June 30, 2008 to 25.62% for
2009.  Our effective income tax rate was lower for 2009 primarily due
to an increase in estimated deductions for statutory depletion.

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk

As a
crude oil and natural gas producer, our revenue, cash flow from operations,
other income and profitability, reserve values, access to capital and future
rate of growth are substantially dependent upon the prevailing prices of crude
oil and natural gas. Declines in commodity prices will materially and adversely
affect our financial condition, liquidity, ability to obtain financing and
operating results. Lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of crude oil and
natural gas that we can produce economically. Prevailing prices for such
commodities are subject to wide fluctuation in response to relatively minor
changes in supply and demand and a variety of additional factors beyond our
control, such as global, political and economic conditions. Historically, prices
received for crude oil and natural gas production have been volatile and
unpredictable, and such volatility is expected to continue. Most of our
production is sold at market prices. Generally, if the commodity indexes fall,
the price that we receive for our production will also decline. Therefore, the
amount of revenue that we realize is to a large extent determined by factors
beyond our control.

Item 4T.
Controls and
Procedures

The
Company maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures that are
designed for the purpose of ensuring that information required to be disclosed
in its SEC reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information
is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the Chief
Executive Officer and the Principal Accounting Officer, as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosures.

For the
quarter ended June 30, 2009 we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision
and with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and
Principal Accounting Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation,
it was concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are
effective for the purposes discussed above.

There
have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
that occurred during the Company’s quarter ended June 30, 2009 that have
materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

In
      October 2008, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock buyback
      program for the Company to repurchase up to 500,000 shares of its common
      stock. The program does not have a specified expiration date, it does not
      require the Company to repurchase any specific number of shares, and the
      Company may terminate the repurchase program at any
      time.  During the three months ended June 30, 2009, 207,000
      shares were repurchased under the stock buyback program and 262,800 shares
      remain available for future repurchase.

 Of
      the shares purchased during this month, 200,000 were purchased in a
      private arms-length transaction at the market
  price.
