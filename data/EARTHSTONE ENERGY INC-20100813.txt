FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS

This
Current Report on Form 10-Q, including information incorporated herein by
reference, contains forward-looking statements as defined in the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The use of any statements containing
the words "anticipate," "intend," "believe," "estimate," "project," "expect,"
"plan," "should" or similar expressions are intended to identify such
statements. Forward-looking statements relate to, among other
things:
 
•      our
future financial position, including anticipated liquidity;
•      our
ability to satisfy obligations from cash generated from operations;
•      amounts
and nature of future capital expenditures;
•      acquisitions
and other business opportunities;
•      operating
costs and other expenses;
•      wells
expected to be drilled;
•      asset
retirement obligations; and
•      estimates
of proved oil and natural gas reserves, deferred tax liabilities, and depletion
rates.
•      our
ability to meet additional acreage, seismic and/or drilling cost requirements
arising from acquisition
opportunities;
  
Factors
that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations
include, among others, such things as:

•      oil
and natural gas prices;
•      our
ability to replace oil and natural gas reserves;
•      loss
of senior management or technical personnel;
•      inaccuracy
in reserve estimates and expected production rates;
•      exploitation,
development and exploration results;
•      the
actual costs related to asset retirement obligations, and whether or not those
retirements actually occur in
the future;
•      a
lack of available capital and financing;
•      the
potential unavailability of drilling rigs and other field equipment and
services;
•      the
existence of unanticipated liabilities or problems relating to acquired
properties;
•      general
economic, market or business conditions;
•      factors
affecting the nature and timing of our capital expenditures, including the
availability of service contractors
and equipment,
•      permitting
issues, workovers, and weather;
•      the
impact and costs related to compliance with or changes in laws or regulations
governing our oil and natural
gas operations;
•      environmental
liabilities;
•      acquisitions
and other business opportunities (or the lack thereof) that may be presented to
and pursued by
us;
•      competition
for available properties and the effect of such competition on the price of
those properties;
•      risk
factors consistent with comparable companies within our industry, especially
companies  with similar
market capitalization 
               and/or
employee census.
•      other
factors, many of which are beyond our control.

Although
we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements
are reasonable, those expectations may prove to be incorrect.  As with
comparable companies within our industry, there are numerous factors that could
cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations.  All
forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made.  All
subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us, or
persons acting on our behalf, are expressly qualified in their entirety by the
cautionary statements.  Except as required by law, we undertake no
obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or
circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of
anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances.

Earthstone Energy, Inc.
Notes
to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements
June
30, 2010

1.
Presentation of Consolidated Financial Statements

The
accompanying interim financial statements of Earthstone Energy, Inc. (formerly
Basic Earth Science Systems, Inc. sometimes referred to as “the Company” “we”
“our” or “us”) are unaudited. However, in the opinion of management, the interim
data includes any applicable adjustments necessary for a fair presentation
according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) of the financial
and operational results for the interim period.

At the
directive of the Securities and Exchange Commission to use “plain English” in
public filings, the Company will use such terms as “we”, “our”, “us” or “the
Company” in place of Earthstone Energy, Inc.  When such terms are used
in this manner throughout this document they are in reference only to the
corporation, Earthstone Energy, Inc. and its subsidiaries, and are not used in
reference to the board of directors, corporate officers, management, or any
individual employee or group of employees.

The
financial statements included herein have been prepared by the Company pursuant
to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements
prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such
rules and regulations. We believe the disclosures made are adequate to make the
information not misleading and suggest that these financial statements be read
in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes thereto included
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2010 and
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended December 31, 2009,
September 30, 2009 and June 30, 2009.

For the
period ended June 30, 2010, we determined that there were no subsequent events
to recognize or disclose in these consolidated financial statements which would
either impact the results reflected in this report or the Company’s results
going forward.

Organization and
Nature of Operations. Earthstone Energy, Inc. was originally organized in
July 1969 as Basic Earth Science Systems, Inc.  We are
principally engaged in the acquisition, exploitation, development, operation and
production of crude oil and natural gas. Our primary areas of operation are the
Williston basin in North Dakota and Montana, south Texas and the
Denver-Julesburg basin in Colorado.

Principles of
Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include our accounts
and those of our wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated.  The Company does not
have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements or any unconsolidated special
purpose entities.

2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting
Pronouncements

Use of Estimates.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the actual amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the actual amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. We base these estimates on assumptions that we understand are
reasonable under the circumstances. The estimated results that are produced by
this effort will differ under different assumptions or conditions.  We
understand that these estimates are necessary, and we caution that actual
results could vary significantly from the estimated amounts for the current and
future periods.

There are
many factors, including global events, which may influence the production,
processing, marketing, and valuation of crude oil and natural gas. A reduction
in the valuation of oil and gas properties resulting from declining prices or
production could adversely impact depletion rates and ceiling test limitations.
We understand the following accounting policies and estimates are necessary in
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: the carrying value of
our oil and gas property, the accounting for oil and gas reserves, the estimate
of our asset retirement obligations, the estimate of our income tax assets and
liabilities and estimates of accrued quantities and prices in our oil and gas
receivable.

Oil and Gas
Reserves. Oil and gas reserves represent theoretical, estimated
quantities of crude oil and natural gas which geological and engineering data
estimate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known
reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. There are numerous
uncertainties inherent in estimating oil and gas reserves and their values,
including many factors beyond our control. Accordingly, reserve estimates are
different from the future quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately
recovered and the corresponding lifting costs associated with the recovery of
these reserves. As of our year end, March 31, 2010, ninety-three percent of our
reported oil and gas reserves are based on estimates prepared by Ryder Scott
Company, L.P, a nationally recognized, independent petroleum engineering firm.
The remaining seven percent of our oil and gas reserves were prepared by our
technical in-house staff.

Each
quarter, we update reserve estimates by substituting the prices that were used
by our independent petroleum engineers with average first-of-the-month prices
for each of the three months of the quarter.  In conducting this
“re-pricing” no changes are made to the decline rates, tax rates or lifting
costs used by our independent petroleum engineers.  The determinations
of depletion expense, as well as the results of ceiling tests and corresponding
write-downs, if any, are highly dependent on these reserve and quarterly
“re-pricing” estimates.

Oil and Gas
Sales. We derive revenue primarily from the sale of produced natural gas
and crude oil. We report revenue on a gross basis for the amounts received
before taking into account production taxes and transportation costs, which are
reported as separate expenses. Revenue is recorded using the sales method, which
occurs in the month production is delivered to the purchaser, at which time
title changes hands. Payment is generally received between 30 and 90 days
after the date of production. We make estimates of the amount of production
delivered to purchasers and the prices we will receive. We use our knowledge of
our properties, their historical performance, NYMEX and local spot market
prices, and other factors as the basis for these estimates. Variances between
estimates and the actual amounts received are recorded when payment is received,
or when better information is available.

Oil and Gas
Property. We follow the full cost method of accounting for our oil and
gas property. Accordingly, all costs associated with the acquisition,
exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized. These
capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test that limits such pooled costs to
the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved
oil and gas reserves discounted at 10 percent plus the lower of cost or
fair value of unproved properties less any associated tax effects. If the full
cost pool of capitalized oil and gas property costs exceeds the ceiling, we will
record a ceiling test write-down to the extent of such excess. This write-down
is a non-cash charge to earnings. If required, it reduces earnings and impacts
stockholders’ equity in the period of occurrence. The write-down may not be
reversed in future periods, even though higher oil and gas prices in the future
may subsequently and significantly increase reserve estimates in future
periods.  As of the balance sheet date, our capitalized costs did not
exceed the ceiling test limit.

Cash and Cash
Equivalents. For purposes of the Consolidated Balance Sheets and
Statements of Cash Flows, we consider all highly liquid investments with a
maturity of ninety days or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The
carrying amount of cash equivalents approximates fair value because of the
short-term maturity of those instruments. During the period and at the balance
sheet date, balances of cash and cash equivalents exceeded the federally insured
limit.

Support Equipment
and Other. Support equipment (including such items as vehicles, office
furniture and equipment and well servicing equipment) is stated at cost.
Depreciation of support equipment and other property is computed using the
straight-line method over periods ranging from five to seven years.

Long-Lived
Assets. We regularly evaluate all long-lived assets for possible
impairment. Assets are reported at the lower of cost or their estimated
recoverable amounts. During the periods ended June 30, 2010 and 2009 there was
no impairment recorded for long-lived assets.

Fair Value
Measurements. Effective April 1, 2009, we adopted the provisions for
nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are not required to be measured at fair
value on a recurring basis, which include, among others, those assets measured
at fair value for impairment assessment and asset retirement obligations
initially measured at fair value. Fair value used in the initial recognition of
asset retirement obligations is determined based on the present value of
expected future dismantlement costs incorporating our estimate of inputs used by
industry participants when valuing similar liabilities. Accordingly, the fair
value is based on unobservable pricing inputs and therefore, is considered a
level 3 value input in the fair value hierarchy.

Asset Retirement
Obligations. We have obligations related to the plugging and abandonment
of our oil and gas wells. We estimate the future cost of these obligations,
discount this cost to its present value, and record a corresponding asset and
liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The values ultimately derived are
based on numerous and significant estimates, including the ultimate expected
cost of the obligation, the expected future date of the required cash
expenditures and inflation rates. The nature of these estimates requires us to
make judgments based on historical experience and future expectations related to
timing. We review the estimate of our future asset retirement obligations
quarterly. These quarterly reviews may require revisions to these estimates
based on such things as changes to cost estimates or the timing of future cash
outlays. Any such changes that result in upward or downward revisions in the
estimated obligation will result in an adjustment to the related capitalized
asset and corresponding liability on a prospective basis.
 
We
recognize two components on our consolidated statement of operations; accretion
of asset retirement obligations and asset retirement
expense.  Accretion of asset retirement obligation reflects the
periodic accretion of the present value of future plugging and abandonment
costs.  Asset retirement expense reflects the actual current period
gains and losses on plugging and abandonment costs relative to previously
estimated future costs. We have closed gains and losses on asset
retirements to the Consolidated Statement of Operations as a component of asset
retirement expense.

The
information below reconciles the value of the asset retirement obligation for
the period presented.  This includes a short term obligation of
$160,000, which is carried within the accrued liabilities line item of the
balance sheet.

Commitments.  We
currently office in a 4,000 square foot office space located in downtown Denver,
Colorado, and are committed to a total of $281,000 plus maintenance fees for the
five-year lease term ending April 1, 2013.  We have no off
balance sheet transactions or arrangements.

Income Taxes.
We account for income taxes with deferred tax liabilities and assets
which are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial
statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in
effect for the year in which the differences are expected to
reverse.

Projections
of future income taxes and their timing require significant estimates with
respect to future operating results. Accordingly, the net deferred tax liability
is continually re-evaluated and numerous estimates are revised over time. As
such, the net deferred tax liability may change significantly as more
information and data is gathered with respect to such events as changes in
commodity prices, their effect on the estimate of oil and gas reserves and the
depletion of these long-lived reserves.

We are
subject to U.S. federal income tax and income tax from multiple state
jurisdictions. The tax years remaining subject to examination by tax authorities
are fiscal years 2007 through 2009. We recognize interest and penalties related
to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. As of June 30, 2010, we made
no provisions for interest or penalties related to uncertain tax
positions.

Earnings Per
Share. Our earnings per share (EPS) is computed by dividing net income by
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted
EPS is calculated by dividing net income by the diluted weighted average number
of common shares. The diluted weighted average number of common shares is
computed using the treasury stock method for common stock that may be issued for
outstanding stock options.  As of the balance sheet date no dilutive
securities were outstanding.
 
Reclassifications.
Certain prior year amounts were reclassified to conform to current year
presentation. Such reclassifications had no effect on net income.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

In
January 2010, guidance for fair value measurements and disclosure was
updated to require additional disclosures related to transfers in and out of
level 1 and 2 fair value measurements and enhanced detail in the level 3
reconciliation. The guidance was amended to clarify the level of disaggregation
required for assets and liabilities and the disclosures required for inputs and
valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities
that fall in either level 2 or level 3. The updated guidance was effective for
the Company’s fiscal year beginning April 1, 2010, with the exception of
the level 3 disaggregation which is effective for the Company’s fiscal year
beginning April 1, 2011. The adoption had no impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

In June
2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Codification, “Accounting Standards
Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles”
(Codification) which will become the source of authoritative U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles (GAAP) recognized by the FASB to be applied by
nongovernmental entities. Rules and interpretive releases of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) under authority of federal securities laws are also
sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. On the effective date of this
Statement, the Codification will supersede all then-existing non-SEC accounting
and reporting standards. All other non-grandfathered non-SEC accounting
literature not included in the Codification will become non-authoritative. 
This Statement is effective for financial statements issued for interim and
annual periods ended after September 15, 2009.  The adoption of the
Codification did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
statements or results of operations.

In
December 2008, the SEC announced final approval of new requirements for
reporting oil and gas reserves. Among the changes to the disclosure requirements
is a broader definition of reserves, which allows reporting of probable and
possible reserves, in addition to consideration of new technologies and
non-traditional resources. In addition, oil and gas reserves will be reported
using an average price based on the first-day-of-the-month price during the
prior 12-month period, rather than year-end prices. The new rules are effective
for years ending on or after December 31, 2009. The adoption of the new
rules is considered a change in accounting principle inseparable from a change
in accounting estimate. The Company does not believe that provisions of the new
guidance, other than pricing, significantly impacted the reserve estimates or
financial statements which also impact the amount recorded for depreciation,
depletion and amortization and the ceiling test calculation for oil and gas
properties. Under the new guidance, subsequent price increases cannot be
considered in the ceiling test calculation. The Company does not believe that it
is practicable to estimate the effect of applying the new rules on net loss or
the amounts recorded for depreciation, depletion and amortization and ceiling
impairment.

Item 2.
Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations
 
The
following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended March 31, 2010, as well as the financial statements and related notes and
other information appearing elsewhere in this report.

As a
crude oil and natural gas producer, our revenue, cash flow from operations,
other income and profitability, reserve values, access to capital and future
rate of growth are substantially dependent upon the prevailing prices of crude
oil and natural gas. Declines in commodity prices will materially and adversely
affect our financial condition, liquidity, ability to obtain financing and
operating results. Lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of crude oil and
natural gas that we can produce economically. Prevailing prices for such
commodities are subject to wide fluctuation in response to relatively minor
changes in supply and demand and a variety of additional factors beyond our
control, such as global, political and economic conditions. Historically, prices
received for crude oil and natural gas production have been volatile and
unpredictable, and such volatility is expected to continue. Most of our
production is sold at market prices. Generally, if the commodity indexes fall,
the price that we receive for our production will also decline. Therefore, the
amount of revenue that we realize is to a large extent determined by factors
beyond our control.
 
Liquidity
and Capital Resources

Liquidity
Outlook. Our primary source of funding is the net cash flow from the sale
of our oil and gas production. The profitability and cash flow generated by our
operations in any particular accounting period will be directly related to:
(a) the volume of oil and gas produced and sold, (b) the average realized
prices for oil and gas sold and (c) lifting costs. Assuming that oil prices
do not decline from current levels, we believe the cash generated from
operations, along with existing cash balances, will enable us to meet our
existing and normal recurring obligations during the next year and
beyond.

Working Capital.
At June 30, 2010, we had a working capital surplus of $4,688,000 (a
current ratio of 3.21:1) compared to a working capital surplus at March 31, 2010
of $5,062,000 (a current ratio of 3.53:1). The decrease in current ratio is
largely a result of the timing between payments made for payables and cash
received for revenue.

Cash Flow.
Net cash provided by operating activities increased 158.8% from $461,000
in the three months ended June 30, 2009 (“2009”) to $1,193,000 in the three
months ended June 30, 2010 (“2010”) primarily due to increased oil and gas
commodity prices and resulting increase in oil and gas revenues, the timing and
collection of receivables, and the timing and application of prepaid
costs.

Net cash
used in investing activities increased 222.8% from $333,000 in the three months
ended June 30, 2009 to $1,075,000 in the three months ended June 30, 2010. The
difference relates primarily to significantly more expenditures made during 2010
on DJ Basin wells in Colorado as well as a new Williston Basin well in North
Dakota.

Net cash
used in financing activities decreased 68.5% from $162,000 in the three months
ended June 30, 2010 to $51,000 in the three months ended June 30,
2010.   Cash used in financing activities related to the stock
buyback program adopted in October 2008.

Credit
Line. Our current banking relationship, established in March 2002,
is with American National Bank (“the Bank”), located in Denver, Colorado.
Subject to evaluation every six months, the line of credit amount was set at $20
million with a concurrent borrowing base of $4 million. Effective
December 31, 2008, the loan agreement was amended to extend the maturity
date of the credit agreement to December 31, 2010.  We renewed
the line with an interest rate of prime plus 0.25% or 6.5% whichever is
higher.  During the year ended March 31, 2010 and for the three
months ended June 30, 2010, we did not utilize our credit
facility.  The loan contains several covenant
restrictions.   At June 30, 2010, we were in compliance with all
covenants.  This line may be used for purposes of borrowing funds to
reduce payables, finance re-completion or drilling efforts, fund property
acquisitions or pursue other opportunities that might arise.

Capital
Expenditures

The
amounts presented herein are presented on an accrual basis, and as such may not
be consistent with the amounts presented on the Consolidated Statement of Cash
Flows under investing activities for expenditures on oil and gas property, which
are presented on a cash basis.

During
the quarter ended June 30, 2010, we spent approximately $791,000 on various
projects.  This compares to $377,000 for the quarter ended June 30,
2009. During the quarter ended June 30, 2010, approximately 81.6% of capital
expenditures were dedicated to drilling and completions, and 17.2% on leasing
property in the Williston Basin.  Of the drilling and completions, we
spent approximately 71.4% on re-completing six of our DJ Basin wells in Colorado
to the J-sand zone.  The remaining expenditures primarily consisted of
the drilling of the Pederson 10-3H, a new Williston Basin well in North
Dakota.  These projects were funded with cash flow from
operations.
 
At
present cash levels, and with the extension of our available borrowing capacity,
we expect to have sufficient funds available for our share of any additional
acreage, seismic and/or drilling cost requirements that might arise from these
opportunities.  We may alter or vary all or part of any planned
capital expenditures for reasons including but not limited to: changes in
circumstances, unforeseen opportunities, inability to negotiate favorable
acquisition, farmout or joint venture terms, lack of cash flow and lack of
additional funding.

We
currently have no capital expenditure commitments.  We are continually
evaluating drilling and acquisition opportunities for possible participation.
Typically, at any one time, several opportunities are in various stages of due
diligence. Our policy is to not disclose the specifics of a project or prospect,
nor to speculate on such ventures, until such time as those various
opportunities are finalized and undertaken. We caution that the absence of news
and/or press releases should not be interpreted as a lack of development or
activity.

Divestitures/Abandonments

During
the quarter ended June 30, 2010, we plugged two wells.

Three
Months Ended June 30, 2010 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30,
2009

Revenues.
Oil and gas sales revenue increased $303,000 (20.8%) in 2010 from 2009 due to
higher realized oil and gas prices. Oil sales revenue increased $307,000
(24.2%), and gas sales revenue decreased $4,000 (2.1%) in 2010 from
2009. 

Volumes and
Prices. Oil sales volume decreased 4.6%, from 24,343 barrels in 2009 to
23,222 barrels in 2010 while there was an increase of 30.2% in the average price
per barrel from $52.17 in 2009 to $67.91 in 2010. Gas sales volume
decreased 31.9% from 35,186 thousand cubic feet (Mcf) in 2009 to 23,964 Mcf in
2010, while the average price per Mcf increased 43.7%, from $5.40 in 2009 to
$7.76 in 2010.  The decrease in gas sales volume is primarily due to
normal decline in production related to the Antenna Federal property in Weld
County, Colorado.  On an equivalent barrel of oil (BOE) basis,
sales volume decreased 9.9% from 30,207 BOE in 2009 to 27,216 BOE in
2010.

Expenses.
Oil and gas production expense increased $33,000 (7.1%) in 2010 over 2009,
primarily due to routine lease operating expense increasing by $106,000 (31.3%)
from $339,000 in 2009 to $445,000 in 2010, and workover expense decreasing
$73,000 (56.6%) from $129,000 in 2009 to $56,000 in 2010.  Routine
lease operating expense per BOE increased 45.7% from $11.22 in 2009 to $16.35 in
2010 due to the recovering oil and gas prices and corresponding increases in
operating costs, while workover expense per BOE decreased 51.8% from $4.27 in
2009 to $2.06 in 2010 due to fewer workover operations in 2010.

Production
taxes, which are generally a percentage of sales revenue, increased $6,000
(5.0%) in 2010 compared to 2009. Production taxes, as a percent of sales revenue
decreased from 8.1% in 2009 to 7.1% in 2010.  The overall lifting cost
(oil and gas production expense and production taxes) per BOE increased 18.4%
from $19.47 in 2009 to $23.04 in 2010.
 
Depreciation
and depletion expense increased $21,000 (8.8%) in 2010 compared to 2009 as a
result of volumes produced as described above coupled with the increase in our
full cost pool, and more specifically, our depletable base during this past year
as compared to 2009.    


General
and administrative (G&A) expense increased $51,000 (15.2%) in 2010 over
2009.  This rise in G&A expense is comprised of $134,000 in
increases and $83,000 in decreases in various expense categories.  Of
the increases, $45,000 relates to the timing of expensing executive bonus which
we now perform quarterly rather than annually, $22,000 in employee compensation
expense, $21,000 in legal expense, $20,000 in other expenses including office,
insurance and tax expenses, $15,000 in oil and gas incentive compensation
expense, and $11,000 in shareholder related expenses including the timing of
proxy statement costs and board of director compensation
expense.  Decreases in G&A costs related to decreases of $83,000
in professional fees including consulting and contractor expenses related to
investor relations, accounting and Sarbanes-Oxley.  G&A expense
per BOE increased 27.9% from $11.09 in 2009 to $14.18 in 2010. As a percent of
total sales revenue, G&A expense decreased from 22.7% in 2009 to 21.9% in
2010.
 

Income
Tax Expense (Benefit). For
the three months ended June 30, 2010, we recorded an income tax expense of
$69,000 as compared to an income tax benefit of $10,000 for the three months
ended June 30, 2009.  Our effective income tax rate decreased from
25.62% for the three months ended June 30, 2009 to 15.47% for the three months
ended June 30, 2010.  Our effective income tax rate was lower for the
three month period ended June 30, 2010 primarily due to an increase in estimated
deductions for statutory depletion.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk
 
As a
“smaller reporting company,” we are not required to provide this
information.
 
Item 4.
Controls and
Procedures

The
Company maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the “Exchange Act”), for the purpose of providing reasonable assurance
that information required to be disclosed in its SEC reports is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SEC’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the
Principal Accounting Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosures.

For the
quarter ended June 30, 2010, we evaluated under the supervision and with the
participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Principal Accounting
Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, we concluded
that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective for the
purposes discussed above.

There
have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
that occurred during the Company’s quarter ended June 30, 2010 that have
materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

On
      October 22, 2008, the Company’s board of directors authorized a stock
      buyback program for the Company to repurchase up to 500,000 shares of its
      common stock for a period of up to 18 months. The program does not require
      the Company to repurchase any specific number of shares, and the Company
      may terminate the repurchase program at any time.  On November
      13, 2009, the board of directors increased the number of shares authorized
      for repurchase to 1,500,000.  On February 10, 2010, the board
      extended the termination date of the program from April 22, 2010 to
      October 22, 2011.  During the three months ended June 30, 2010,
      48,084 shares were repurchased under the stock buyback program and
      1,156,286 shares remain available for future
